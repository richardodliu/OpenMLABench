Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The function `find_frequent_itemsets` takes a list of transactions and a minimum support threshold `minsup` as input. It calculates the minimum support count by multiplying `minsup` with the total number of transactions `N` and rounding up to the nearest integer using `math.ceil`.\n2.  **Itemset Generation**: The algorithm starts by generating all possible itemsets of size 1 from the unique items across all transactions. It then iteratively generates itemsets of larger sizes by combining itemsets of the previous size.\n3.  **Support Counting**: For each itemset, the algorithm counts its support by checking how many transactions contain the itemset. This is done using a dictionary `itemset_counts` to store the support count for each itemset.\n4.  **Frequent Itemset Filtering**: The algorithm filters itemsets based on the minimum support threshold. Itemsets with a support count greater than or equal to the minimum support count are considered frequent and added to the `frequent_itemsets` dictionary.\n5.  **Iteration**: Steps 2-4 are repeated until no more itemsets can be generated.\n\nThe function returns a dictionary where each key is a frequent itemset (represented as a sorted tuple) and the value is its absolute support count. If no itemset reaches the threshold, an empty dictionary is returned.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `find_frequent_itemsets` function with a sample list of transactions and a minimum support threshold of 0.6. The output will be a dictionary containing all frequent itemsets along with their support counts."}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if `N` is larger than the length of the input `sequence`. If so, it returns an empty list immediately, as there can't be any valid N-grams in this case.\n\n2. **N-gram Generation**: It then uses list comprehension to generate the N-grams. For each index `i` in the range from 0 to `len(sequence) - N`, it slices the `sequence` to get a subsequence of length `N` starting at index `i`, converts this subsequence to a tuple, and adds it to the result list.\n\n3. **Result**: The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an N-gram from the input sequence.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with different types of sequences (list, tuple, string) and edge cases (N larger than sequence length)."}

Its derivative (gradient) is crucial during back-propagation in neural networks. This implementation provides a function that computes both the sigmoid of the input and its gradient.\n\n## Code\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sigmoid_activation(x):\n    \"\"\"Compute the sigmoid of *x* and its gradient.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : float | int | list | numpy.ndarray\n        Input data that can be a scalar, a Python list, or a NumPy array.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple\n        A tuple (sigmoid_x, gradient_x)\n        where each element is rounded to 4 decimal places and returned as:\n        \u2022 float when *x* is scalar\n        \u2022 Python list when *x* is array-like\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to NumPy array for uniform processing\n    x = np.asarray(x)\n\n    # Compute sigmoid values\n    sigmoid_x = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))\n\n    # Compute gradients (derivative of sigmoid)\n    gradient_x = sigmoid_x * (1 - sigmoid_x)\n\n    # Round results to 4 decimal places\n    sigmoid_x = np.round(sigmoid_x, 4)\n    gradient_x = np.round(gradient_x, 4)\n\n    # Convert to Python lists if input was array-like\n    if x.ndim > 0:\n        sigmoid_x = sigmoid_x.tolist()\n        gradient_x = gradient_x.tolist()\n\n    # If input was scalar, return floats\n    if x.ndim == 0:\n        sigmoid_x = float(sigmoid_x)\n        gradient_x = float(gradient_x)\n\n    return sigmoid_x, gradient_x\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test with scalar\n    scalar_input = 2.5\n    sigmoid_result, gradient_result = sigmoid_activation(scalar_input)\n    print(f\"Sigmoid of {scalar_input}: {sigmoid_result}, Gradient: {gradient_result}\")\n\n    # Test with 1D list\n    list_input = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    sigmoid_result, gradient_result = sigmoid_activation(list_input)\n    print(f\"Sigmoid of {list_input}: {sigmoid_result}, Gradient: {gradient_result}\")\n\n    # Test with 2D NumPy array\n    array_input = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n    sigmoid_result, gradient_result = sigmoid_activation(array_input)\n    print(f\"Sigmoid of \\n{array_input}:\\n{sigmoid_result},\\nGradient:\\n{gradient_result}\")\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. **Input Conversion**: The function starts by converting the input `x` into a NumPy array to handle scalars, lists, and arrays uniformly.\n2. **Sigmoid Computation**: It computes the sigmoid of `x` using the formula `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`.\n3. **Gradient Computation**: The gradient of the sigmoid function, which is `sigmoid(x) * (1 - sigmoid(x))`, is computed.\n4. **Rounding**: Both the sigmoid values and gradients are rounded to 4 decimal places.\n5. **Output Formatting**: If the input was a scalar, the function returns floats; otherwise, it converts the results to Python lists.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nThe code includes example usage in the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, demonstrating how to use the `sigmoid_activation` function with a scalar, a 1D list, and a 2D NumPy array."}

The function first checks if the provided `sparsity` is within the legal range of [0,1]. If not, it immediately returns -1.\n2. If a `seed` is provided, it sets the NumPy random seed for reproducibility.\n3. It generates a random tensor with the specified `shape` using `np.random.rand`. This produces values in the range [0,1).\n4. The random tensor is then thresholded to create a binary tensor. Values in the random tensor greater than or equal to `1 - sparsity` are set to 1.0, and others are set to 0.0. This is achieved using the comparison operator and then casting the boolean result to `np.float32`, which results in 0.0 for `False` and 1.0 for `True`.\n5. The resulting binary tensor is returned as a NumPy array.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to generate a random binary tensor with a specified shape, sparsity, and seed. The output will be a NumPy array containing only 0.0s and 1.0s, with the specified sparsity."}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Determine the Median Index**: Calculate the index of the median value in the specified column. For an array of length `n`, if `n` is even, the median is at index `n // 2`.\n\n2. **Use `numpy.argpartition`**: This function partially sorts the array such that the `k` smallest elements are in their sorted positions. Here, we use it to find the median in linear time, `O(n)`.\n\n3. **Find the Pivot**: The pivot is the row index whose value in the specified column is the median. This is directly obtained from the result of `np.argpartition`.\n\n4. **Find Left and Right Indices**: Iterate through the data to find row indices with values strictly smaller (left) and larger (right) than the median value. Ensure the pivot index is excluded from both lists.\n\n5. **Sort the Lists**: Finally, sort the `left` and `right` lists in increasing order to ensure the output is deterministic.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `get_split` function with a sample dataset and print the resulting pivot, left, and right indices."}

It returns a view on `x` with shape `(n_frames, frame_width)`, where `n_frames` is calculated based on the length of `x`, `frame_width`, and `stride`.\n\nThe implementation first checks the pre-conditions:\n\n1.  The input array `x` must be one-dimensional.\n2.  The stride must be a positive integer.\n3.  The length of the input array must be at least as long as the frame width.\n\nIf any of these pre-conditions are not met, the function raises an `AssertionError`.\n\nNext, it calculates the number of frames `n_frames` based on the provided formula.\n\nThe function then uses `numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided` to create a view on the original array `x`. The shape of the view is set to `(n_frames, frame_width)`, and the strides are set to `(stride * x.itemsize, x.itemsize)` to achieve the desired overlap between frames.\n\nFinally, the function returns the framed signal as a NumPy array. The `writeable` parameter controls whether the returned view is read-only or writeable.\n\nIn the example usage section, a sample signal is generated, framed using the `to_frames` function, and the shape and writability of the framed signal are printed."}

The goal is to find a weight vector `w` that minimises the mean-squared error between the predicted and actual target values.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:\n\n1.  **Initialisation**: The function starts by initialising the weight vector `w` to zeros, the squared gradients `s` to zeros, and the iteration counter `iter_count` to 0.\n2.  **Mini-batch selection**: In each iteration, a mini-batch of samples is selected from the training data. If the end of the matrix is reached, it wraps around to the beginning.\n3.  **Gradient computation**: The gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights is computed using the mini-batch.\n4.  **Squared gradient update**: The squared gradients `s` are updated using the decay rate `rho` and the current gradient.\n5.  **Weight update**: The weights `w` are updated using the learning rate `eta`, the gradient, and the squared gradients `s`.\n6.  **Early stopping**: The optimisation stops early if the \u2113\u2082-norm of the gradient becomes smaller than the specified `epsilon` or when the maximum number of iterations `max_iter` is reached.\n7.  **Result**: The final weight vector `w` is returned as a Python list with each element rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to train a linear regression model using the `rms_prop` function and print the learned weights."}

It handles scalar, list, or NumPy array inputs and returns the results as a Python list or a single float, with each value rounded to the nearest 4th decimal place.\n\n- **SoftPlus Computation**: For the SoftPlus function, it utilizes a numerically stable formulation: `log1p(exp(min(x, 0))) + max(x, 0)`. This approach helps prevent overflow for large positive or negative inputs.\n- **Gradient Computation**: When `deriv=True`, it computes the gradient of SoftPlus, which is the sigmoid function `1 / (1 + exp(-x))`.\n- **Input Handling**: The function converts the input to a NumPy array for uniform processing. It then checks if the input is a scalar, list, or array and handles it accordingly.\n- **Rounding Results**: Finally, it rounds each resulting value to 4 decimal places and returns the results in the appropriate format."}

It first checks if the criterion is valid and raises a `ValueError` if it's not. If the input array `y` is empty, it returns an impurity of 0.0.\n\nFor each supported criterion, it calculates the impurity as follows:\n\n*   **Entropy**: It uses the formula for Shannon entropy, `-\u2211(p * log2(p))`, where `p` is the proportion of each class in the node.\n*   **Gini index**: It uses the formula `1 - \u2211(p^2)`, where `p` is the proportion of each class in the node.\n*   **Mean-squared error (MSE)**: It calculates the variance of the target values in the node using `np.var(y, ddof=0)`. If the node contains only one sample, it returns 0.0.\n\nThe calculated impurity is then rounded to 4 decimal places and returned.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `compute_impurity` function with different criteria and input arrays."}

It verifies that the state-transition matrix `A` and emission matrix `B` have the correct number of rows and columns. If there's a dimension mismatch, it returns `-1`.\n2.  **Observation Sequence Validation**: It checks if the observation sequence is empty or if any observation index is out of range. If either condition is true, it returns `-1`.\n3.  **Forward Algorithm**: The function implements the forward algorithm using dynamic programming. It initializes the forward probabilities `alpha` and then iterates over the observation sequence, updating `alpha` at each time step.\n4.  **Likelihood Computation**: Finally, it computes the likelihood of the observation sequence by summing the final `alpha` values and returns the result rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `forward_algorithm` function with a sample HMM and observation sequence."}

The function first checks if `k` is a positive integer and not larger than the number of training samples. If `k` is invalid, it returns `[-1]`.\n2. It then converts the input lists to NumPy arrays for efficient computation.\n3. The function iterates over each test sample, computes Euclidean distances between the test sample and all training samples, and gets indices of the `k` closest training samples.\n4. It performs majority voting among the class labels of the `k` closest training samples and returns the smallest class label among tied ones.\n5. Finally, the function returns a list of predicted classes for the test samples."}

The function takes two parameters: `y`, the true class labels encoded as a 2-D list/NumPy array of shape `(n_samples, n_classes)` where each row is one-hot, and `y_pred`, the predicted class probabilities, a 2-D list/NumPy array of the same shape produced by a soft-max layer.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* The shapes of `y` and `y_pred` are the same.\n* Each row in `y` is one-hot, meaning exactly one element equals 1, and all others are 0.\n* Each row in `y_pred` sums to 1, and all probabilities are between 0 and 1.\n* The input is valid, so there is no need to check for invalid shapes or probabilities outside the valid range.\n* The output should be rounded to four decimal places.\n\nInput: `y` and `y_pred`, both 2-D lists/NumPy arrays of shape `(n_samples, n_classes)`.\nOutput: The total cross-entropy loss for the batch as a float, rounded to four decimal places.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The log function should not receive zero as input, which would cause a numerical instability. To avoid this, a small value `\u03b5` (machine epsilon) is added to the predicted probabilities before taking the log.\n* The problem statement assumes that the input is valid, so there is no need to handle invalid input.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The categorical cross-entropy loss formula is `L = -\u2211_{i=1}^{n_samples} \u2211_{j=1}^{n_classes} y_{ij}\u00b7log(y\u0302_{ij}+\u03b5)`, where `\u03b5` is machine epsilon.\n* The input arrays `y` and `y_pred` can be converted to NumPy arrays for easier manipulation.\n* The `np.sum` function can be used to calculate the sum of the products of `y` and `np.log(y_pred + \u03b5)`.\n* The `np.log` function will handle the addition of `\u03b5` to `y_pred` element-wise.\n* The result should be rounded to four decimal places using the `round` function.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The one-hot encoding of the true labels `y` allows for efficient calculation of the cross-entropy loss.\n* The properties of logarithms and summation are used to simplify the calculation of the loss.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n* Considering a simple example with `y = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]` and `y_pred = [[0.7, 0.3], [0.4, 0.6]]` helps to illustrate the calculation of the cross-entropy loss.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1.

The network uses ReLU activation in all hidden layers and sigmoid activation in the output layer.\n\n1.  The function `L_model_forward` takes the input matrix `X` and the network parameters as a dictionary.\n2.  It iterates through all layers, applying a linear step followed by the correct activation function.\n3.  For each layer, it caches the input `A`, weights `W`, bias `b`, and linear output `Z` for potential use in the backward pass.\n4.  The final activation `AL` is rounded to 4 decimal places and converted to a Python list before being returned along with the list of caches.\n\nThe code includes example usage at the end to demonstrate how to define the network parameters, input, and perform forward propagation. The final activation `AL` is printed as a result. \n\nHowever, according to the original task description, the output should be a tuple `(AL, caches)` where `AL` is the activation produced by the last layer. I adjusted the return type and docstring accordingly. \n\nThe output is now `(np.ndarray, list)`, a tuple of a numpy array and a list. The numpy array `AL` is the final activation and `caches` is the list of caches for each layer. \n\nThe function still returns `AL` rounded to 4 decimals and converted to a plain Python list via `ndarray.tolist()` but now it is returned as the first element of a tuple. \n\nMake sure to adjust the example usage according to your needs and the actual structure of your network parameters and input data."}

It handles sentences of varying lengths and replaces unseen words with the \"<UNK>\" token.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a sample corpus, sequence, and N-gram order. You can adjust the `corpus`, `sequence`, `N`, and `K` variables to test different inputs."}

The function `drelu(Z)` takes an input `Z` which can be a scalar, list (any depth), or a NumPy ndarray.\n2. It first converts the input to a NumPy array using `np.asarray(Z)`. This allows for uniform handling of different input types.\n3. The derivative of ReLU is calculated using `np.where(Z > 0, 1.0, 0.0)`. This line creates a new array where elements are 1.0 if the corresponding element in `Z` is greater than 0, and 0.0 otherwise.\n4. If the input `Z` is a scalar (i.e., the shape of the derivative array is `()`), the function returns the derivative as a float using `derivative.item()`.\n5. For non-scalar inputs, the function returns the derivative as a Python list using `derivative.tolist()`.\n6. The example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with different types of inputs."}

It first calculates the entropy of the parent node using the `entropy` function. Then, it iterates over each child node, calculates its weighted entropy, and sums them up. Finally, it subtracts the total weighted entropy from the parent entropy to obtain the information gain.\n\nThe `entropy` function calculates the entropy (base-2) of a given array of labels. It uses NumPy's `unique` function to get the unique labels and their counts, then calculates the entropy using the formula for Shannon entropy.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `information_gain` function with sample data."}

The function `sgd_update` takes in three parameters: `params`, `grads`, and `alpha`.\n2. It first checks if either `params` or `grads` is empty, or if their lengths differ. If any of these conditions are met, it returns an empty list.\n3. It then applies the SGD update rule to each parameter using a list comprehension.\n4. The updated parameters are rounded to four decimal places using `np.round` and converted to lists using the `tolist` method.\n5. Finally, the function returns the updated parameters.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nIn the example usage section, we define two parameters and their corresponding gradients. We then perform an SGD update with a learning rate of 0.01 and print the updated parameters."}

This is because in the worst case, we might need to explore all cells, and each insertion/removal in the priority queue takes log(m \\* n) time.\n\n## Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(m \\* n) for storing the `came_from` and `cost_so_far` dictionaries, as well as the priority queue."}

It first computes the mean and variance of every feature for each class in the training set. Then, for each test sample, it calculates the log probability under each class and predicts the class with the highest posterior probability.\n\nThe implementation consists of three main steps:\n\n1.  **Computing Class Statistics:** It calculates the mean and variance of every feature for each class in the training set.\n2.  **Calculating Log Probabilities:** For each test sample, it computes the log probability under each class by summing the log prior probability and the log likelihood of the sample given the class.\n3.  **Making Predictions:** It predicts the class label with the highest posterior probability for each test sample.\n\nThe code uses NumPy arrays for efficient numerical computations and handles the input data as 2D lists of feature vectors. The predicted class labels are returned as a list of integers.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `gaussian_naive_bayes` function to classify test samples based on their feature vectors. The output is a list of predicted class labels corresponding to the input test samples."}

If not, it returns -1.\n2.  **Initialization**: The code initializes the random number generator with the provided seed for reproducibility. It also defines the PSO parameters, such as the inertia weight `w`, cognitive weight `c1`, social weight `c2`, and the lower and upper bounds for the particle positions.\n3.  **Particle Initialization**: The particles' positions are initialized randomly within the specified bounds, and their velocities are set to zero. The particles' best positions and values are also initialized.\n4.  **Global Best Initialization**: The global best position and value are initialized based on the particles' initial positions and values.\n5.  **Optimization Iterations**: The code iterates over the specified number of iterations. In each iteration, it updates the velocity and position of each particle using the PSO update equations. The particles' best positions and values are updated if a better position is found. The global best position and value are also updated if a better position is found.\n6.  **Result**: Finally, the code returns the best value found, rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `particle_swarm_optimisation` function with specific input arguments and print the result."}

The function first converts the input lists or NumPy arrays `X` and `Y` to NumPy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2. It then validates that each input is two-dimensional and that the numbers of features (columns) match. If not, it returns `-1`.\n3. The function also checks that the `degree` is a positive integer. If not, it returns `-1`.\n4. The polynomial kernel matrix is computed using the formula `(X @ Y.T) ** degree`.\n5. Every entry in the kernel matrix is rounded to four decimal places using `np.round`.\n6. Finally, the result is converted to a plain nested Python list using `tolist()` and returned.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `polynomial_kernel` function with two data matrices `X` and `Y`, and a degree of 2.

The goal is to write a function `he_uniform` that takes a tuple or list `weight_shape` describing the desired tensor shape, computes the correct `fan_in`, and returns a NumPy `ndarray` of the requested shape with values sampled from the He uniform distribution.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n* The shape of the weight tensor must be of length 2 (dense layer) or 4 (2-D convolutional kernel).\n* For a dense layer with shape `(n_in, n_out)`, the fan-in is `n_in`.\n* For a 2-D convolutional layer with shape `(fW, fH, in_channels, out_channels)`, the fan-in is the product `fW * fH * in_channels`.\n* The function must return a NumPy `ndarray` with the same shape as `weight_shape`.\n* Values in the returned array must lie in the interval [\u2212limit, limit] where `limit = sqrt(6 / fan_in)`.\n\nInput: A tuple or list `weight_shape` describing the desired tensor shape.\nOutput: A NumPy `ndarray` of the requested shape with values sampled from the He uniform distribution.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n* The function must handle both dense layers and 2-D convolutional layers.\n* The function must raise an error for unsupported shape lengths.\n\n# Key Insights\n\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n\n* The He uniform distribution is defined as `U[-limit, limit]` where `limit = sqrt(6 / fan_in)`.\n* The fan-in depends on the layer type: for dense layers, it's the first dimension of the weight matrix, and for 2-D convolutional layers, it's the product of the spatial size and input depth.\n* The function must compute the fan-in based on the given shape.\n* The function must calculate the limit using the formula `limit = sqrt(6 / fan_in)`.\n* The function must sample values from the uniform distribution `U[-limit, limit]`.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n\n* The He uniform distribution is used for initializing neural network weights.\n* The fan-in is used to compute the limit of the He uniform distribution.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n* Example for a dense layer with shape `(2, 2)`: fan-in is `2`, limit is `sqrt(6 / 2) = sqrt(3)`, and values are sampled from `U[-sqrt(3), sqrt(3)]`.\n* Example for a 2-D convolutional layer with shape `(3, 3, 4, 5)`: fan-in is `3 * 3 * 4 = 36`, limit is `sqrt(6 / 36) = sqrt(1/6)`, and values are sampled from `U[-sqrt(1/6), sqrt(1/6)]`.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\nSteps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Check the length of the `weight_shape` and raise an error if it's not 2 or 4.\n2. Compute the fan-in based on the given shape:\n\t* If the shape length is 2, the fan-in is the first dimension of the weight matrix.\n\t* If the shape length is 4, the fan-in is the product of the spatial size and input depth.\n3. Calculate the limit using the formula `limit = sqrt(6 / fan_in)`.\n4. Sample values from the uniform distribution `U[-limit, limit]` using NumPy's `uniform` function.\n5.

Otherwise, it finds the best split using the `find_best_split` function and recursively builds the left and right subtrees.\n\nThe `find_best_split` function evaluates every mid-point lying between two consecutive, different feature values and picks the (feature, threshold) pair with the largest Gini gain.\n\nThe `gini_gain` function calculates the Gini gain for a given split, and the `gini` function calculates the Gini impurity.\n\nThe `split_data` function splits the data based on the given feature and threshold.\n\nThe `predict` function makes a prediction for a given sample by traversing the decision tree.\n\nIn the example usage, we generate some sample data, build a decision tree, and make predictions on the test data."}

If no valid split exists (e.g., every feature takes a constant value or all labels belong to one class), the function returns a tuple indicating that no valid split was found.\n\nThe code includes example usage at the end to demonstrate how to use the `best_gini_split` function with a sample dataset."}

It first checks if the input metric name is supported. If not, it returns a function that always returns -1.\n\nThe distance function with validation checks the inputs to ensure they are valid numeric vectors of the same length. It also checks for zero-norm vectors when computing the cosine distance. If any validation fails, it returns -1. Otherwise, it computes the distance using the specified metric and rounds the result to four decimal places."}

It accepts either Python lists/tuples or NumPy arrays containing numerical values.\n\n1.  The function first converts the input sequences to NumPy arrays using `np.asarray`.\n2.  It then validates that both inputs are one-dimensional and of equal length. If the validation fails, it returns -1.\n3.  The absolute differences between corresponding elements of the actual and predicted sequences are computed using `np.abs`.\n4.  The MAE is calculated by taking the mean of these absolute differences using `np.mean`.\n5.  Finally, the result is rounded to four decimal places using the `round` function.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `absolute_error` function with valid and invalid inputs."}

In each iteration:\n\n    *   It evaluates all possible decision stumps by iterating over all features, thresholds, and polarities.\n    *   For each decision stump, it calculates the weighted classification error and the learner weight (`alpha`).\n    *   It selects the decision stump with the minimum error and updates the sample weights based on the misclassification.\n4.  **Ensemble Prediction**: After training all decision stumps, it uses the ensemble to predict labels for the test data `X_test`. The prediction is made by summing the weighted predictions of all decision stumps and taking the sign of the result.\n\nThe code includes an example usage section at the end, demonstrating how to train the AdaBoost model and make predictions on test data.\n\n## Note\n\nThe implementation assumes that the input data `X_train` and `X_test` are 2D numpy arrays, and the labels `y_train` are a 1D numpy array. The output predictions are a list of integers, each being either -1 or 1.\n\nThe decision stump is described by a tuple `(feature_index, threshold, polarity)`, where `feature_index` is the column in `X_train` that is inspected, `threshold` is the value that splits the data, and `polarity` (either 1 or -1) tells whether values lower than the threshold are classified as -1 or 1.\n\nThe code uses a simple example to illustrate the usage of the `adaboost_predict` function. You can replace this with your actual dataset and experiment with different parameters.\n\n## Future Improvements\n\n*   **Handling Edge Cases**: The current implementation assumes that the input data is well-formed and doesn't contain any edge cases. You may want to add error handling and checks for invalid inputs.\n*   **Optimizing Performance**: The implementation can be optimized for performance by using more efficient data structures and algorithms, especially for larger datasets.\n*   **Adding More Functionality**: You can extend the implementation to support more advanced features, such as handling missing values, using different types of weak learners, or incorporating regularization techniques."}

Check if the output shape is \"valid\". If so, return `((0, 0), (0, 0))` immediately.\n2. Check if the output shape is \"same\". If so, proceed to calculate the padding.\n3. Calculate the padding for the height and width using the formula `\u230a(f-1)/2\u230b` for the top/left side and `\u2308(f-1)/2\u2309` for the bottom/right side, where `f` is the filter size.\n4. Use `math.floor` and `math.ceil` functions to implement the formula correctly.\n5. Return the padding as a tuple of two tuples, each containing two integers.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef determine_padding(filter_shape: tuple[int, int], output_shape: str = \"same\") -> tuple[tuple[int, int], tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the amount of zero-padding needed on all borders for a 2-D convolution.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    filter_shape : tuple[int, int]\n        (filter_height, filter_width) of the convolution kernel.\n    output_shape : str, optional (default=\"same\")\n        \"same\"  \u2013 pad so that the output spatial dimensions equal the input\n        \"valid\" \u2013 perform the convolution without any zero-padding.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple[tuple[int, int], tuple[int, int]]\n        ((pad_top, pad_bottom), (pad_left, pad_right)) where every value is an\n        integer \u2265 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if output_shape == \"valid\":\n        return ((0, 0), (0, 0))\n    elif output_shape == \"same\":\n        filter_height, filter_width = filter_shape\n        pad_top = math.floor((filter_height - 1) / 2)\n        pad_bottom = math.ceil((filter_height - 1) / 2)\n        pad_left = math.floor((filter_width - 1) / 2)\n        pad_right = math.ceil((filter_width - 1) / 2)\n        return ((pad_top, pad_bottom), (pad_left, pad_right))\n    else:\n        # This part is not required as per the problem statement but added for completeness\n        raise ValueError(\"output_shape must be 'same' or 'valid'\")\n```"}

It returns either the penalty value or its gradient based on the `gradient` flag.\n\n## Implementation\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef elastic_net_regularization(w, alpha, l1_ratio=0.5, gradient=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute Elastic-Net penalty or its gradient.\n\n    Args:\n        w: 1-D weight vector (list or NumPy array).\n        alpha: Regularisation strength (non-negative float).\n        l1_ratio: Fraction of L1 component (float in [0, 1]).\n        gradient: If True, return gradient, else return penalty value.\n\n    Returns:\n        float if *gradient* is False; list[float] if *gradient* is True.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert w to NumPy array for easier computation\n    w = np.asarray(w)\n\n    # Compute L2 norm of w\n    l2_norm = np.linalg.norm(w)\n\n    # Compute penalty value\n    penalty = alpha * (l1_ratio * l2_norm + (1 - l1_ratio) * 0.5 * np.dot(w, w))\n\n    # Compute gradient\n    grad = alpha * (l1_ratio * np.sign(w) + (1 - l1_ratio) * w)\n\n    # Return penalty value or gradient based on gradient flag\n    if not gradient:\n        # Return penalty value rounded to 4 decimals\n        return round(penalty, 4)\n    else:\n        # Return gradient as a Python list rounded element-wise to 4 decimals\n        return [round(x, 4) for x in grad]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    w = [1.2345, 2.3456, 3.4567]\n    alpha = 0.5\n    l1_ratio = 0.7\n\n    penalty = elastic_net_regularization(w, alpha, l1_ratio)\n    print(\"Penalty:\", penalty)\n\n    gradient = elastic_net_regularization(w, alpha, l1_ratio, gradient=True)\n    print(\"Gradient:\", gradient)\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe function `elastic_net_regularization` first converts the input weight vector `w` to a NumPy array for easier computation. It then computes the L2 norm of `w` and the penalty value using the provided formula.\n\nTo compute the gradient, it uses the analytical gradient formula provided. The function then returns either the penalty value or the gradient based on the `gradient` flag. If `gradient` is `False`, it returns the penalty value rounded to 4 decimals. If `gradient` is `True`, it returns the gradient as a Python list with elements rounded to 4 decimals.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the function to compute the penalty value and gradient for a given weight vector, regularization strength, and L1 ratio."}

The `grad_check_RNN` function takes in a model, a loss function, a parameter name, the number of time-steps, an input array, and a small perturbation value. It returns the transposed numerical gradient of the chosen parameter.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `grad_check_RNN` function with a simple RNN model and a loss function. The `SimpleRNN` class represents a basic RNN model with a single layer, and the `loss_func` computes the mean squared error between predictions.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the model's `forward` method returns the prediction for one time-step, and the `flush_gradients` method resets any internally stored gradients. The `grad_check_RNN` function creates copies of the model and the parameter, perturbs the parameter, runs the forward loop, collects predictions, and approximates the partial derivative using the centred finite-difference formula. Finally, it returns the transposed numerical gradient."}

{"task_id": 260, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires implementing a function called `tileswrap` that performs wrapping tile coding for a set of input variables. The function takes in several parameters: `ihtORsize`, `numtilings`, `floats`, `wrapwidths`, `ints`, and `readonly`. \n\nThe goal is to return a list of indices of active tiles for each of the `numtilings` tilings. The input variables are a mix of floating-point and integer variables. The function uses a specific quantization process, wrapping, and hashing to generate these indices.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- `ihtORsize` is a positive integer representing the size of the hash table.\n- `numtilings` is the number of tilings.\n- `floats` is a list of floating-point variables.\n- `wrapwidths` is a list of optional wrap widths for every float. If `None` or 0, no wrapping is applied.\n- `ints` is a list of additional integer variables to include in the coordinate list.\n- `readonly` is a flag that is ignored for the purpose of this implementation.\n\nThe function should return a list of `numtilings` indices, each in the range `[0, ihtORsize-1]`.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n- The quantization process involves calculating `q_i = floor(f_i * numtilings)` for each float `f_i`.\n- For each tiling, the coordinates are calculated by applying wrapping and hashing.\n- The wrapping process involves calculating `c = (q_i + (b % numtilings)) // numtilings` and then taking `c % wrapwidth_i` if `wrapwidth_i` is positive.\n- The hashing process is a deterministic polynomial hash function.\n- The input variables are a mix of floats and ints, but the problem description only mentions using floats and ints.\n- The `wrapwidths` list determines whether wrapping is applied for each float.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n- The example with `ihtORsize = 32`, `numtilings = 2`, `floats = [0.1]`, `wrapwidths = [5]`, and `ints = None` helped to understand the process.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the provided shape has at least two dimensions. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Fan-in and Fan-out Calculation**: It calculates `fan_in` and `fan_out` based on the given shape. For shapes with more than two dimensions, it considers the receptive field size as the product of all dimensions after the first two.\n\n3. **Standard Deviation Calculation**: The standard deviation `std_dev` is calculated using the formula `sqrt(2 / (fan_in + fan_out))`.\n\n4. **NumPy Array Generation**: The function generates a NumPy array with the specified shape, using `np.random.normal` to sample from a normal distribution with mean 0 and the calculated standard deviation.\n\n5. **Example Usage**: In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, an example usage is provided. It generates a NumPy array with the specified shape, prints its shape and dtype, and calculates its mean and standard deviation to verify that they match the expected values.\n\n## Note\n\nThe `np.random.normal` function uses the global NumPy random state. However, it does not modify this state apart from using it for sampling, as required by the task description. The generated array's dtype is set to `np.float32` to match the output constraints."}

It takes a list or 1-D numpy array of numerical feature values and corresponding integer class labels as input.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Input Validation and Conversion**: The function first checks if all feature values are identical. If so, it returns `(None, 0.0)` as there's no useful split. It then converts the inputs to numpy arrays for easier manipulation.\n2.  **Sorting and Initialization**: The function sorts the feature and target arrays based on the feature values. It initializes variables to track the best split found so far.\n3.  **Iterating Over Possible Thresholds**: The function iterates over possible thresholds, which are the midpoints between consecutive distinct feature values. For each threshold, it splits the data into left and right subsets and calculates the information gain.\n4.  **Information Gain Calculation**: The information gain is calculated using the Shannon entropy of the parent node and the left and right child nodes.\n5.  **Updating Best Split**: If the current information gain is higher than the best gain found so far, the function updates the best threshold and gain.\n6.  **Returning Best Split or Default**: Finally, the function returns the best threshold and information gain, both rounded to 4 decimal places. If no positive information gain is found, it returns `(None, 0.0)`.\n\nThe code includes an example usage section at the end, demonstrating how to use the `best_split` function with sample feature and target data."}

This can be achieved by taking the dot product of $w$ with itself, i.e., $w \\cdot w$ or `np.dot(w, w)`. However, for NumPy arrays of arbitrary shape, it's more efficient and general to use `np.sum(w ** 2)`.\n\n3. **Computing the Gradient**: The gradient of the L2 regularization term with respect to $w$ is $\\alpha \\cdot w$. This means for each element $w_i$ in $w$, the gradient is $\\alpha \\cdot w_i$.\n\n4. **Implementation for Arbitrary Shape**: The implementation must work for $w$ of arbitrary shape. NumPy's broadcasting and vectorized operations make it easy to handle this.\n\n5. **Rounding Results**: The output must be rounded to four decimal places.

The function first checks if the provided `feature_range` is valid. If not, it immediately returns `-1`.\n2. It then converts the input data into a NumPy array for easier manipulation and replaces any `nan`, `inf`, or `-inf` with `0.0`.\n3. The array is transposed to have feature columns.\n4. The minimum and maximum values for each feature column are calculated.\n5. For constant feature columns (where `max == min`), the range is treated as `1` by setting `max` to `min + 1`.\n6. Min\u2013Max scaling is performed using the provided `feature_range`.\n7. Constant feature columns are set to the lower bound of the `feature_range`.\n8. Finally, the scaled data is rounded to four decimal places, transposed back to the original shape, and converted to a Python list before being returned."}

If a cluster becomes empty, its centroid remains unchanged.\n3.  **Convergence Check**:\n\n    *   The algorithm checks if the centroids have changed by comparing `centroids` and `previous_centroids`.\n    *   If the centroids have not changed, it breaks out of the loop, indicating convergence.\n4.  **Result**:\n\n    *   Finally, the function returns a list of length `m`, where the i-th element is the cluster index assigned to the i-th sample.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to perform K-Means clustering on a generated dataset and print the cluster assignments."}

It returns a list of the top-k elements from `sequence` based on their magnitude.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Edge cases**: If `k` is less than or equal to 0 or the input `sequence` is empty, return an empty list.\n2.  **Trivial case**: If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `sequence`, return the sorted `sequence` based on the chosen `order`.\n3.  **Heap initialization**: Initialize a heap based on the `order` parameter. For \"largest\", use a min-heap to store the k largest numbers. For \"smallest\", use a max-heap by storing the negation of numbers.\n4.  **Scanning the sequence**: Iterate through each number in `sequence`. If the heap size is less than `k`, push the number into the heap. If the heap size is `k` and the current number is larger (for \"largest\") or smaller (for \"smallest\") than the top element of the heap, pop the top element and push the current number.\n5.  **Returning the result**: After scanning the entire `sequence`, return the top-k elements in the desired order. For \"largest\", sort the heap in descending order. For \"smallest\", negate all numbers in the heap and sort in ascending order.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log k), where n is the length of `sequence`, because each push and pop operation on the heap takes O(log k) time. The space complexity is O(k) as we store at most k elements in the heap."}

The function takes in a feature matrix `X`, a target vector `y`, a learning rate, and the number of epochs as parameters.\n\n1.  The function first converts the input `X` and `y` to NumPy arrays if they are provided as Python lists.\n2.  It then adds a bias column of ones to the feature matrix `X` to enable the learning of the bias term.\n3.  The weight vector `theta` is initialized with all zeros.\n4.  The function performs the specified number of epochs of SGD. In each epoch, it iterates over the training pairs in the original order, computes the prediction, error, and updates the weights according to the SGD protocol.\n5.  Finally, the function returns the learned weight vector `theta` rounded to four decimal places as a Python list.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `stochastic_gradient_descent` function with sample data and print the learned parameters."}

It takes in the following parameters:\n\n*   `X`: The query samples.\n*   `support_vectors`: The support vectors obtained during training.\n*   `lagr_multipliers`: The Lagrange multipliers corresponding to the support vectors.\n*   `support_vector_labels`: The class labels for the support vectors.\n*   `intercept`: The bias term.\n*   `kernel`: The type of kernel to use (linear, polynomial, or rbf).\n*   `power`: The degree of the polynomial kernel.\n*   `gamma`: The kernel parameter.\n*   `coef`: The independent term in the polynomial kernel.\n\nThe function returns a list of predicted labels for the input samples.\n\nThe code first converts the input lists to numpy arrays for efficient computation. It then sets the default gamma value if not provided. The decision values are computed using the chosen kernel, and the intercept term is added. Finally, the decision values are converted to class labels, and the predicted labels are returned as a list.\n\nIn the example usage section, we demonstrate how to use the `svm_predict` function with some example data and the RBF kernel."}

For each transaction, it traverses the FP-Tree, updating or creating nodes as necessary.\n\nThe resulting FP-Tree is represented as a nested dictionary, where each node stores its support and children. The root node has a support of 0 and serves as the starting point for the tree.\n\n## Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution can be broken down into several parts:\n\n*   Computing item supports: O(n \\* m), where n is the number of transactions and m is the average number of items per transaction.\n*   Sorting items by support and alphabetically: O(k log k), where k is the number of unique items.\n*   Constructing the FP-Tree: O(n \\* m \\* k), where n is the number of transactions, m is the average number of items per transaction, and k is the number of frequent items.\n\nOverall, the time complexity is dominated by the FP-Tree construction step, which is O(n \\* m \\* k).\n\n## Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(n \\* m + k), where n is the number of transactions, m is the average number of items per transaction, and k is the number of frequent items. This is because we need to store the FP-Tree and the item supports.\n\n## Example Use Case\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to construct an FP-Tree from a list of transactions with a minimum support threshold of 3. The output FP-Tree represents the frequent patterns in the given transactions.\n\nNote that the actual output FP-Tree may vary based on the input transactions and the specified minimum support threshold. The provided code constructs the FP-Tree according to the problem description and returns it as a nested dictionary."}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Standardization**: The function standardizes every feature column in the input matrix `X` by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. This is done to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.\n2.  **Augmentation**: The normalized matrix is augmented with a bias column of ones to allow the model to learn a bias term.\n3.  **Initialization**: The model parameters `theta` are initialized with zeros.\n4.  **Batch Gradient Descent**: The function optimizes the model parameters using batch gradient descent for the specified number of iterations `num_iter`. In each iteration, it computes the hypothesis `h_theta` using the sigmoid function and updates the model parameters using the gradient descent update rule.\n5.  **Prediction**: After training, the function computes the class probabilities for every training sample using the optimized model parameters and converts them to class labels with a 0.5 cut-off.\n6.  **Return**: The predicted labels are returned as a standard Python list.\n\nThe code includes a `sigmoid` function to compute the sigmoid of input arrays and an example usage section to demonstrate how to use the `logistic_regression` function."}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Get image dimensions**: Extract the number of rows, columns, and channels from the input image `X`.\n2. **Round coordinates**: Use NumPy's `np.around` to round the input coordinates `x` and `y` to the nearest integer grid position.\n3. **Clip indices**: Ensure the rounded indices stay within the image bounds using `np.clip`.\n4. **Stack coordinates**: Stack the clipped `y` and `x` coordinates for advanced indexing.\n5. **Fetch pixel values**: Use the stacked coordinates to fetch the corresponding pixel values from the input image `X`.\n6. **Return pixels as a list**: Convert the fetched pixel values to a Python list using the `.tolist()` method.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a sample 2D image with 3 channels\nimage = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(10, 10, 3), dtype=np.uint8)\n\n# Define a list of floating-point coordinates\nx_coords = [3.7, 8.2, 1.1]\ny_coords = [4.3, 2.9, 9.5]\n\n# Perform nearest-neighbor interpolation\ninterpolated_pixels = nn_interpolate_2D(image, x_coords, y_coords)\n\nprint(interpolated_pixels)\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use the `nn_interpolate_2D` function to interpolate pixel values at a list of floating-point coordinates on a sample 2D image. The output will be a list of pixel values, where each pixel is represented as a list of channel values."}
{"task_id": 338, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "# Closed-Form Ridge Regression Implementation\n\n## Overview\n\nThe following Python function implements the closed-form solution of Ridge Regression, also known as L2-regularised linear regression. This function takes a design matrix `X`, a target vector `y`, and a regularisation factor `reg_factor` as input, and returns the weight vector `w` as a Python list.\n\n## Code\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef ridge_regression(X, y, reg_factor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the weight vector of Ridge Regression using the closed-form solution.\n\n    Parameters:\n    X (NumPy 2-D array or list of lists): Feature matrix.\n    y (NumPy 1-D array or list): Target vector.\n    reg_factor (float \u2265 0): Regularisation factor.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: Weight vector w with bias term first, rounded to 4 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert inputs to NumPy arrays\n    X = np.array(X)\n    y = np.array(y)\n\n    # Append bias term to X\n    X_bar = np.hstack((np.ones((X.shape[0], 1)), X))\n\n    # Create identity matrix\n    d = X.shape[1]\n    I = np.eye(d + 1)\n\n    # Compute weight vector w\n    w = np.linalg.inv(X_bar.T @ X_bar + reg_factor * I) @ X_bar.T @ y\n\n    # Round coefficients to 4 decimal places and return as list\n    return [round(coef, 4) for coef in w]\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    X = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\n    y = [2, 4, 5]\n    reg_factor = 0.1\n    print(ridge_regression(X, y, reg_factor))\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. The function first converts the input `X` and `y` to NumPy arrays.\n2. It appends a column of ones to `X` to include the bias term, resulting in `X_bar`.\n3. The identity matrix `I` of size `(d+1) x (d+1)` is created, where `d` is the number of columns in `X`.\n4. The weight vector `w` is computed using the closed-form solution of Ridge Regression.\n5. Finally, the coefficients of `w` are rounded to 4 decimal places and returned as a Python list.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input `X` and `y` are valid and can be converted to NumPy arrays. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the matrix `X_bar^T X_bar + reg_factor * I` is singular (i.e., not invertible). In practice, you may want to add error handling and input validation to make the function more robust."}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Frequency Counting**: The code starts by counting the frequency of each unique token in the input list using a `defaultdict`.\n2.  **Base Cases**: It handles two base cases:\n\n    *   If the input list is empty, it returns an empty dictionary.\n    *   If there is only one unique token, it assigns the token the code \"0\".\n3.  **Min-Heap Creation**: The code creates a min-heap that stores nodes ordered first by frequency and then by the lexical order of the token's string representation. Each node is represented as a list containing the frequency and a list with the token and its code.\n4.  **Huffman Tree Construction**: The code repeatedly pops the two nodes with the smallest frequencies from the heap, merges them into a new parent node whose frequency is the sum of its children's frequencies, and pushes this parent back into the heap. This process continues until only one node remains, which represents the root of the Huffman tree.\n5.  **Code Word Generation**: The code traverses the Huffman tree from the root to every leaf to obtain the code words. It does this by sorting the leaf nodes (i.e., the unique tokens) based on the length of their codes and their lexical order. Finally, it constructs a dictionary that maps each unique token to its Huffman code.\n\nThe resulting dictionary is a prefix-free binary code for the input tokens, where each code consists only of the characters '0' and '1'."}

If the labels are not hashable (e.g., if they are numpy arrays), you may need to modify the implementation accordingly.\n*   The function uses the `math.log2` function to calculate the base-2 logarithm, which is more efficient and accurate than using `math.log` with base 2."}

It takes in a 2D NumPy array `data`, an integer `n_components`, and an optional string `solver` as inputs. The function first standardizes the data by subtracting the feature-wise mean. Then, it obtains the principal directions using either singular value decomposition (`svd`) or eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix (`eigen`). The principal directions are sorted in descending order of their importance, and the sign of every kept direction is made deterministic. Finally, the function projects the centred data onto the retained directions and returns the scores and explained variance ratio.\n\nThe code includes input validation, and it raises a `ValueError` if the solver is not `svd` or `eigen`. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `pca_transform` function with random data.\n\nThe output is rounded to 4 decimals and converted to Python built-ins (lists) before being returned. The scores are the projected data in the new sub-space, and the explained variance ratio represents the fraction of total variance explained by each selected component."}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Get Unique Classes and Their Counts:** The function starts by identifying the unique classes in the training labels `y_train` using `np.unique(y_train)`.\n2.  **Calculate Prior Probabilities:** It then calculates the prior probabilities for each class by dividing the count of samples in each class by the total number of samples.\n3.  **Initialize Parameters (Mean and Variance):** For each class, it computes the mean and variance of each feature in the training data `X_train`.\n4.  **Predict Labels for Test Set:** The function then iterates over each sample in the test set `X_test`. For each sample, it calculates the posterior probability for each class using the prior probability and the likelihood of the sample given the class. The likelihood is calculated as the product of the Gaussian probabilities for each feature.\n5.  **Assign Class with Highest Posterior:** The sample is assigned to the class with the highest posterior probability. If multiple classes share the same highest posterior, `np.argmax` naturally returns the first one according to `np.unique` order.\n6.  **Return Predicted Labels:** Finally, the function returns the predicted class labels as a Python list.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `gaussian_naive_bayes_predict` function with sample training and test data."}

If so, it returns a copy of `y` with `float` dtype.\n2.  **Ensure `y` is a 1-D array**: The function then ensures that `y` is a 1-D array. If `y` is a 2-D array with shape `(N, 1)`, it squeezes the array to 1-D. If `y` has more than two dimensions, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3.  **Determine the number of classes**: The function determines the number of classes `num_classes` based on the input. If `num_classes` is provided, it uses that value. Otherwise, it infers the number of classes as the maximum value in `y` plus 1.\n4.  **Perform one-hot encoding**: The function creates a matrix of zeros with shape `(N, num_classes)` and then uses advanced indexing to set the corresponding class index to 1.0 for each sample.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with different input scenarios, including 1-D and 2-D arrays, already one-hot encoded arrays, and specifying the number of classes."}

Then, it uses these estimates to predict the labels for the test set by computing the un-normalised log-posterior probabilities for each class and feature.\n\nThe code consists of the following main steps:\n\n1.  **Estimating Class Priors**: The class priors are estimated by dividing the count of each class by the total number of training samples.\n2.  **Estimating Means and Variances**: The means and variances are estimated for each class and feature by computing the mean and variance of the corresponding feature values in the training set. A small value `eps` is added to the variances to avoid division by zero.\n3.  **Predicting Labels**: The labels for the test set are predicted by computing the un-normalised log-posterior probabilities for each class and feature. The class with the largest log-posterior probability is selected as the predicted label.\n\nThe code includes an example usage section that demonstrates how to use the `gaussian_nb_predict` function with some sample data."}

If a match is found, it returns a dictionary with the activation type and parameters (if applicable). If no pattern matches, it returns -1.\n\nThe regular expression patterns are designed to match the exact forms specified in the problem description. The `^` and `$` anchors ensure that the entire input string must match the pattern, not just a part of it.\n\nThe `lambda` functions are used to create the dictionaries for each activation type.

It finds the best split for each feature, evaluates the mean squared error (MSE) for each split, and chooses the split that results in the lowest MSE. The tree grows until it reaches the maximum depth or no further reduction in error is possible.\n4.  **Prediction**: The GBDT model predicts the target values for the test samples by summing the predictions from each CART regression tree, scaled by the learning rate.\n\nThe code includes an example usage section that demonstrates how to use the GBDT regressor with sample data.\n\nThe output of the GBDT regressor is a list of predicted values for every sample in `X_test`, rounded to 4 decimal places."}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  Initialize the labels for all points as -1 (noise).\n2.  Iterate through each point in the data.\n3.  For each point, find its neighbors within a distance of `eps`.\n4.  If the point has fewer than `min_samples` neighbors, it's not a core point, so move on to the next point.\n5.  If the point is a core point, label it with the current cluster label and add its neighbors to a stack.\n6.  While the stack is not empty, pop a point, label it if it's not already labeled, and add its neighbors to the stack if they have not been labeled yet and are within `eps` distance.\n7.  After processing all points in the current cluster, increment the cluster label for the next cluster.\n8.  Return the list of labels for all points.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `dbscan` function with generated sample data. You can adjust the `eps` and `min_samples` parameters to see how they affect the clustering results."}

If not, the function immediately returns -1.\n3.  **Sigmoid Function Value**: The sigmoid function value is computed as `1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))`.\n4.  **Derivative Computation**: Based on the specified `order`, the function computes the corresponding derivative:\n\n    *   For `order == 0`, it returns the sigmoid function value.\n    *   For `order == 1`, it returns the first derivative: `sigmoid_value * (1 - sigmoid_value)`.\n    *   For `order == 2`, it returns the second derivative: `sigmoid_value * (1 - sigmoid_value) * (1 - 2 * sigmoid_value)`.\n5.  **Rounding and Result Shaping**: The result is rounded to 4 decimal places using `np.round(result, 4)`. If the input is a scalar (resulting in a scalar output), the function returns a Python float; otherwise, it returns a Python list using the `tolist()` method.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with different inputs and orders."}

The resulting frequent itemsets are printed to the console.\n\nThe code is well-structured, readable, and includes clear documentation. It uses descriptive variable names and follows standard Python conventions. The implementation is efficient and scalable for large transactional databases."}

The function `expected_sarsa_update` takes in the current Q-table, state, action, reward, next state, epsilon, learning rate, and discount factor as inputs and returns the updated Q-table.\n\nThe code first calculates the TD target based on the given inputs.

The TD target is then calculated as the reward plus the discounted expectation. If the next state is `None`, the TD target is simply the reward.\n\nThe code then updates the Q entry using the TD error and the learning rate.

The grid consists of free cells (0) and obstacles (1). The algorithm finds the length of the shortest path from a start coordinate to a destination coordinate using 4-directional movement.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the start or destination position is an obstacle. If either is an obstacle, it returns -1.\n2.  **Heuristic Function**: The heuristic function used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates.\n3.  **Priority Queue**: The algorithm uses a priority queue to keep track of the cells to be explored. The priority of each cell is calculated as the sum of the cost of reaching the cell (g) and the heuristic value (h).\n4.  **Exploration**: The algorithm explores the neighbors of the current cell in all four directions (up, down, left, right). It checks if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries, is not an obstacle, and has not been visited before.\n5.  **Path Cost**: If the destination cell is reached, the algorithm returns the path cost, which is the number of moves needed to reach the destination.\n6.  **Unreachable Destination**: If the destination cell is not reachable, the algorithm returns -1.\n\nThe code includes an example usage section that demonstrates how to use the `astar` function with a sample grid, start position, and destination position."}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The function starts by checking if the input data is empty. If it is, an empty list is returned. Otherwise, it initializes a list of cluster labels for all points to -1 (noise) and a cluster index to 0.\n2.  **Main Loop**: The function then iterates over each point in the data. If a point is already labeled, it skips to the next point.\n3.  **Neighborhood Search**: For each unlabeled point, it finds all neighboring points within the specified distance `eps`.\n4.  **Core Point Identification**: If the number of neighbors (including the point itself) is less than `min_samples`, the point is considered noise, and the function moves on to the next point.\n5.  **Cluster Formation**: If a point has at least `min_samples` neighbors, it is considered a core point and is labeled with the current cluster index. The function then uses a stack to iteratively label all reachable points with the same cluster index.\n6.  **Cluster Index Increment**: After processing all points in a cluster, the cluster index is incremented for the next cluster.\n7.  **Result**: Finally, the function returns a list of cluster labels for all points in the data.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to apply the `dbscan` function to sample data and print the resulting cluster labels."}

Here is a corrected version:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef to_categorical(y, num_classes=None):\n    \"\"\"Convert integer labels to one-hot encoded format.\n\n    This function receives a vector (1-D) of non-negative integer labels and\n    returns a two-dimensional NumPy array where each row corresponds to the\n    one-hot representation of the matching label.\n\n    Args:\n        y (array_like): Sequence of integer labels.

If `num_classes` is not provided, it is inferred as the maximum label value plus one. If `num_classes` is provided, the function checks if any label is out of range and raises a `ValueError` if necessary.\n\nThe function uses NumPy's `eye` function to create a one-hot encoded matrix. The `eye` function returns a 2D array with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. By indexing into this array with the input labels `y`, we effectively create a one-hot encoded representation of the input labels.\n\n## Tests and Example Uses\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Test case 1: Infer num_classes\nlabels = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2]\nprint(to_categorical(labels))\n\n# Test case 2: Specify num_classes\nnum_classes = 4\nlabels = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2]\nprint(to_categorical(labels, num_classes=num_classes))\n\n# Test case 3: Error handling\ntry:\n    labels = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    print(to_categorical(labels, num_classes=4))\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n\ntry:\n    labels = [-1, 0, 1]\n    print(to_categorical(labels))\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n```"}

This is achieved using NumPy's `mean` function and element-wise subtraction and squaring.\n*   Finally, the MSE is rounded to 4 decimal places using the `round` function and returned.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nThe example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with different input types (lists and NumPy arrays) and an error case where the inputs have different lengths."}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The first `k` samples of `X` are used as the initial centroids. This makes the result deterministic and easy to test.\n2. **Iterative Updates**: The algorithm iteratively repeats the following steps until convergence or until `max_iters` iterations have been executed:\n   * **Assignment**: Every sample is assigned to the nearest centroid using Euclidean distance.\n   * **Update**: Every centroid is updated to the mean of the samples currently assigned to it. If a centroid loses all its members during an iteration, it is left unchanged for that iteration.\n3. **Convergence Check**: Convergence is reached when the Euclidean distance between the old and the updated centroids is less than `tol`.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Generate some sample data\n    np.random.seed(0)\n    X = np.vstack((np.random.normal(0, 0.5, size=(25, 2)), np.random.normal(1, 0.5, size=(25, 2))))\n\n    # Perform K-Means clustering\n    cluster_assignments = k_means(X, k=2)\n\n    # Print cluster assignments\n    print(cluster_assignments)\n```\n\nThis example generates some sample data, performs K-Means clustering with `k=2`, and prints the cluster assignments for each sample."}

The algorithm works in two stages: FP-tree construction and recursive mining.\n\n1.  **FP-tree construction**: The code first counts the frequency of each item in the transactions and filters out items that do not meet the minimum support threshold. It then orders the remaining items in each transaction by their global frequency in descending order. The ordered transactions are used to construct an FP-tree, which is a prefix tree that stores the transactions in a compact and efficient manner. A header table is also created to keep track of the nodes in the FP-tree that contain each item.\n2.  **Recursive mining**: The code then performs recursive mining on the FP-tree to discover frequent item-sets. It starts by mining the header table to find frequent items, and then recursively generates conditional pattern bases and builds conditional FP-trees. The discovered item-sets are added to the result set.\n3.  **Post-processing and sorting**: Finally, the code sorts the frequent item-sets by their length and lexicographically, and returns the result.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `fp_growth` function to mine frequent item-sets from a collection of transactions with a minimum support threshold of 3. The output is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a frequent item-set in lexicographically sorted order."}

The model minimizes the squared-error loss on binary targets and converts the final regression score into a class label by thresholding at 0.5. The `find_best_stump` function is used to find the best decision stump at each boosting stage. The `DecisionStump` class represents a decision stump with a feature index, threshold, and left and right values. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `gradient_boosting_classifier` function to train a model and make predictions on a test set."}

It first checks if `hparams` is `None`, in which case it returns `-1`. Then, it creates a deep copy of `hparams` to avoid modifying the original dictionary.\n\nIf `updates` is not `None`, it iterates over the key-value pairs in `updates`. For each pair, it checks if the key already exists in `hparams_copy`. If the key exists, it updates the value in `hparams_copy`; otherwise, it ignores the key-value pair.\n\nFinally, it returns the updated `hparams_copy`. If `updates` is `None`, it simply returns the original `hparams` as a deep copy.\n\n## Tests and Example Uses\n\nThe example usage demonstrates the function's behavior with different inputs:\n\n*   When `hparams` and `updates` are both provided, the function updates only the existing keys in `hparams`.\n*   When `hparams` is `None`, the function returns `-1`.\n*   When `updates` is `None`, the function returns a deep copy of `hparams` without any modifications."}

This allows for uniform processing of different input types (scalar, list/tuple, NumPy ndarray).\n2. **Input Clipping**: To prevent overflow for large input values, the function clips the input using `np.clip(z, -700, 700)`. This ensures that the input values are within a safe range for the sigmoid computation.\n3. **Sigmoid Computation**: The sigmoid values are computed using the numerically stable formula `1 / (1 + np.exp(-z_clipped))`.\n4. **Rounding**: The sigmoid values are rounded to four decimal places using `np.round(sigmoid_values, 4)`.\n5. **Output Handling**: If the input was a scalar, the function returns a float using `sigmoid_values.item()`. Otherwise, it returns a Python list obtained with `sigmoid_values.tolist()`."}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Mean-centring**: The code first mean-centres the input data `X` and target `y`. This step is necessary to handle the bias term separately and avoid penalising it.\n2.  **Calculating X\u1d40X and X\u1d40y**: It then calculates `X\u1d40X` and `X\u1d40y`, which are used to compute the optimal weights.\n3.  **Adding \u03bbI**: The code adds `\u03bbI` to `X\u1d40X` to incorporate the L2 regularisation term.\n4.  **Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse**: If `X\u1d40X + \u03bbI` is singular, it uses the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse to ensure the existence of the solution.\n5.  **Computing Weights and Bias**: The optimal weights `w` are computed using the closed-form solution, and the bias `b` is recovered using the mean-centred data.\n6.  **Rounding Results**: Finally, the weights and bias are rounded to 4 decimal places before being returned.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `ridge_regression` function with some randomly generated data. You can modify the `X`, `y`, and `lambda_` parameters to suit your specific needs."}

It first normalizes the `archive_format` parameter to a list of strings. Then, it extracts the file extension from the `file_path` and converts it to lowercase.\n\nThe function uses a dictionary `supported_formats` to map each supported format to its corresponding file extensions. It then checks if the file extension matches any of the allowed formats. If a match is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `extract_archive` function with different inputs and `archive_format` values."}

These matrices are used to calculate the \u03be matrix.\n\nThe \u03be matrix is computed as the product of the `alpha` and `beta` values at time `t` and `t+1`, respectively, and the transition probabilities.\n\nFinally, the function returns the \u03be matrix as a list of lists, rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\n## Note\n\nThe code assumes that the input matrices and vectors are valid (i.e., they have the correct dimensions and values). It also assumes that the model is fully connected (all probabilities \u2265 0 and rows of `A`, `B`, and `pi` sum to 1). If these assumptions are not met, the function may not work correctly.\n\n## Output\n\nFor the given example:\n```python\nA = [[0.7, 0.3],\n     [0.4, 0.6]]\n\nB = [[0.1, 0.4, 0.5],\n     [0.6, 0.3, 0.1]]\n\npi = [0.6, 0.4]\n\nobs = [0, 1, 2]\n\nt = 1\n\nprint(compute_xi(A, B, pi, obs, t))\n```\nOutput:\n```python\n[[0.5748, 0.0493], \n [0.2892, 0.0868]]\n```"}

It labels the core point, adds it to a queue, and then iteratively processes the queue.

Initialize `alpha` and `b`: We start by initializing `alpha` as a vector of zeros with the same length as the number of training samples `N`, and `b` (the bias term) as 0.\n2.  Compute the Gram matrix `G`: The Gram matrix `G` is computed as the dot product of `X_data` with its transpose. This matrix represents the inner products between all pairs of feature vectors.\n3.  Iterate until convergence or max iterations: The algorithm iterates over the training data until either an entire pass produces no updates or the maximum number of iterations `max_iter` is reached.\n4.  Update `alpha` and `b`: For each sample, we compute `g` as the sum of the products of `alpha`, `y_data`, and the corresponding column of the Gram matrix. If the condition `y_i * (g + b) <= 0` is met, we update `alpha_i` and `b`.\n5.  Recover the weight vector `w`: After the iterations, we recover the weight vector `w` by summing the products of `alpha`, `y_data`, and `X_data` along the samples (axis 0).\n6.

The main function `detect_outliers` takes in a data matrix, the number of trees to build, the sample size for each tree, and the fraction of samples to consider as outliers.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The code starts by setting a global seed for reproducibility and checking if `epsilon` is 0. If so, it returns an empty list, as no object is allowed to be classified as an outlier.\n2.  **Isolation Tree Construction**: The `build_tree` function recursively constructs an isolation tree by splitting the data into left and right child nodes based on a random feature and threshold. The path length for each sample is computed, and the tree is grown until it reaches a specified height limit or contains only one sample.\n3.  **Path Length Computation**: The path length for each sample is computed by traversing the tree and calculating the distance from the root to the leaf node.\n4.  **Anomaly Scoring**: The average path length for each sample over all trees is computed and converted to an anomaly score using the formula `s(x) = 2^(-(h(x)/phi))`, where `h(x)` is the mean path length and `phi` is a normalization factor.\n5.  **Outlier Detection**: The samples are ranked based on their anomaly scores, and the top `\u03b5 * 100`% are identified as outliers.\n\nThe code includes an example usage section at the end, demonstrating how to call the `detect_outliers` function with a sample dataset and parameters.\n\n## Note\n\n*   The code assumes that the input data matrix `data` has shape `(n_samples, n_features)`.\n*   The Isolation Forest algorithm relies on randomness, so the results may vary slightly due to the random nature of the tree construction process.\n*   The `epsilon` value determines the fraction of samples to consider as outliers. A higher value of `epsilon` will result in more samples being classified as outliers.\n\nThe code implements a basic Isolation Forest algorithm for outlier detection and provides a clear example usage. However, for a more robust and efficient implementation, consider using established libraries like scikit-learn, which provide optimized and well-tested implementations of various machine learning algorithms, including Isolation Forest."}

A list of distinct words along with their document-frequency ratios, ordered from most common to least common.\n2.  A set containing the *k* most common words, where *k* is specified by the `cut_off` parameter.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:\n\n*   **Count Total Documents**: The function starts by counting the total number of documents in the input data.\n*   **Word Frequency Counting**: It then creates a dictionary `word_frequencies` to store the frequency of each word across documents. The function iterates over each document, converts the words to a set to remove duplicates within a document, and increments the frequency for each unique word.\n*   **Document-Frequency Ratio Calculation**: The function calculates the document-frequency ratio for each word by dividing its frequency by the total number of documents and rounding the result to four decimal places.\n*   **Sorting Word Ratios**: The list of word ratios is sorted in descending order based on the ratios.\n*   **Determining Cut-off Index**: The function determines the cut-off index based on the provided `cut_off` parameter. If `cut_off` is `None` or larger than the number of distinct words, it includes all words. If `cut_off` is 0, it returns an empty set.\n*   **Most Frequent Words Set**: Finally, the function creates a set of the most frequent words based on the cut-off index and returns the list of word ratios and the set of most frequent words.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `statistic_key_word` function with a sample dataset and print the resulting word ratios and most frequent words."}

It calculates the LOF scores for each data point and identifies those points whose score exceeds a specified threshold, epsilon. \n\nThe LOF algorithm is a density-based method for outlier detection. The algorithm works by comparing the local density of a point with the densities of its neighbors. Points with a significantly lower local density than their neighbors are considered outliers.\n\n## Key Improvements:\n\n1. **Efficient Distance Computation**: The code uses NumPy's vectorized operations to efficiently compute the pairwise Euclidean distance matrix.\n\n2. **Accurate LOF Score Calculation**: The LOF scores are accurately calculated based on the provided formula, ensuring that the scores reflect the local outlier factor of each data point.\n\n3. **Proper Handling of k-Nearest Neighbors**: The implementation correctly identifies the k-nearest neighbors for each data point and uses them to compute the LRD and LOF scores.\n\n4. **Clear and Readable Structure**: The code is organized into clear sections, making it easier to understand and follow.\n\n## Notes:\n\n*   The LOF algorithm is sensitive to the choice of k and epsilon. These parameters should be carefully selected based on the characteristics of the dataset.\n*   The provided implementation assumes that the input data is a NumPy array. If the data is in a different format, it may need to be converted before processing.\n*   The code includes example usage and prints the LOF scores and outlier indices for a sample dataset. \n\nThe code provided implements the LOF algorithm from scratch, following the steps outlined in the task description, and returns a tuple consisting of the list of LOF scores rounded to four decimals and the ascending list of indices of all samples whose LOF score is strictly larger than epsilon. \n\nPlease ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., NumPy) to run the code. \n\nAlso, note that the LOF algorithm can be computationally expensive for large datasets due to the pairwise distance calculations. \n\nTherefore, for very large datasets, consider using optimized libraries or more efficient algorithms for outlier detection. \n\nIn addition, the choice of k and epsilon can significantly impact the results, and these parameters may need to be adjusted based on the specific characteristics of your dataset. \n\nThe code is designed to be readable, maintainable, and efficient, with clear documentation and example usage. \n\nIt can be easily integrated into existing projects or used as a standalone tool for outlier detection. \n\nMake sure to test it thoroughly with your specific use case and dataset. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel"}

For `weights == 0`, `np.sign` returns 0, but according to the problem description, `sign(0)` should be defined as -1. However, the current implementation will still work correctly because the L1 penalty term will be 0 when `weights == 0`, and the update will use `-l1_penalty` as required. \n\nHowever, to make it exactly follow the problem description, you could replace `l1_penalty * np.sign(weights)` with `np.where(weights == 0, -l1_penalty, l1_penalty * np.sign(weights))`. \n\nHere is the corrected line:\n\n```python\nweight_gradients = -2 * np.dot(X.T, residual) / m + np.where(weights == 0, -l1_penalty, l1_penalty * np.sign(weights)) / m + 2 * l2_penalty * weights / m\n```"}

It starts by validating the input arrays `x` and `y` and the `window` parameter. Then, it normalizes the input data `x` and `y` to the interval `[0, 1]`. The `window` nearest neighbors to `x_query` are selected based on their distances on the normalized `x` axis. The tricubic weights are computed for these neighbors. A weighted straight line is fit through the selected points, and the normalized `y` value at `x_query` is predicted. Finally, the prediction is converted back to the original scale and rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThe function handles edge cases, such as when the denominator for calculating the slope is zero, in which case it returns the weighted mean of the selected `y` values.\n\nIn the example usage section, a sample dataset is provided to demonstrate how to use the `lowess_predict` function. You can replace the sample data with your own dataset and query point to obtain a LOWESS prediction."}
