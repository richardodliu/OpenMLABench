Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The function `find_frequent_itemsets` takes a list of transactions and a minimum support threshold `minsup` as input. It calculates the minimum support count by multiplying `minsup` with the total number of transactions `N` and rounding up to the nearest integer using `math.ceil`.\n2.  **Itemset Generation**: The algorithm starts by generating all possible itemsets of size 1 from the unique items across all transactions. It then iteratively generates itemsets of larger sizes by combining itemsets of the previous size.\n3.  **Support Counting**: For each itemset, the algorithm counts its support by checking how many transactions contain the itemset. This is done using a dictionary `itemset_counts` to store the support count for each itemset.\n4.  **Frequent Itemset Filtering**: The algorithm filters itemsets based on the minimum support threshold. Itemsets with a support count greater than or equal to the minimum support count are considered frequent and added to the `frequent_itemsets` dictionary.\n5.  **Iteration**: Steps 2-4 are repeated until no more itemsets can be generated.\n\nThe function returns a dictionary where each key is a frequent itemset (represented as a sorted tuple) and the value is its absolute support count.

The function first checks if the provided `sparsity` is within the legal range of [0,1]. If not, it immediately returns -1.\n2. If a `seed` is provided, it sets the NumPy random seed for reproducibility.\n3. It generates a random tensor with the specified `shape` using `np.random.rand`. This produces values in the range [0,1).\n4. The random tensor is then thresholded to create a binary tensor. Values in the random tensor greater than or equal to `1 - sparsity` are set to 1.0, and others are set to 0.0. This is achieved using the comparison operator and then casting the boolean result to `np.float32`, which results in 0.0 for `False` and 1.0 for `True`.\n5. The resulting binary tensor is returned as a NumPy array.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to generate a random binary tensor with a specified shape, sparsity, and seed. The output will be a NumPy array containing only 0.0s and 1.0s, with the specified sparsity."}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Determine the Median Index**: Calculate the index of the median value in the specified column. For an array of length `n`, if `n` is even, the median is at index `n // 2`.\n\n2. **Use `numpy.argpartition`**: This function partially sorts the array such that the `k` smallest elements are in their sorted positions. Here, we use it to find the median in linear time, `O(n)`.\n\n3. **Find the Pivot**: The pivot is the row index whose value in the specified column is the median. This is directly obtained from the result of `np.argpartition`.\n\n4. **Find Left and Right Indices**: Iterate through the data to find row indices with values strictly smaller (left) and larger (right) than the median value. Ensure the pivot index is excluded from both lists.\n\n5. **Sort the Lists**: Finally, sort the `left` and `right` lists in increasing order to ensure the output is deterministic.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `get_split` function with a sample dataset and print the resulting pivot, left, and right indices."}

It returns a view on `x` with shape `(n_frames, frame_width)`, where `n_frames` is calculated based on the length of `x`, `frame_width`, and `stride`.\n\nThe implementation first checks the pre-conditions:\n\n1.  The input array `x` must be one-dimensional.\n2.  The stride must be a positive integer.\n3.  The length of the input array must be at least as long as the frame width.\n\nIf any of these pre-conditions are not met, the function raises an `AssertionError`.\n\nNext, it calculates the number of frames `n_frames` based on the provided formula.\n\nThe function then uses `numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided` to create a view on the original array `x`. The shape of the view is set to `(n_frames, frame_width)`, and the strides are set to `(stride * x.itemsize, x.itemsize)` to achieve the desired overlap between frames.\n\nFinally, the function returns the framed signal as a NumPy array.

If the end of the matrix is reached, it wraps around to the beginning.\n3.  **Gradient computation**: The gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights is computed using the mini-batch.\n4.  **Squared gradient update**: The squared gradients `s` are updated using the decay rate `rho` and the current gradient.\n5.  **Weight update**: The weights `w` are updated using the learning rate `eta`, the gradient, and the squared gradients `s`.\n6.  **Early stopping**: The optimisation stops early if the \u2113\u2082-norm of the gradient becomes smaller than the specified `epsilon` or when the maximum number of iterations `max_iter` is reached.\n7.  **Result**: The final weight vector `w` is returned as a Python list with each element rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to train a linear regression model using the `rms_prop` function and print the learned weights."}

The network uses ReLU activation in all hidden layers and sigmoid activation in the output layer.\n\n1.  The function `L_model_forward` takes the input matrix `X` and the network parameters as a dictionary.\n2.  It iterates through all layers, applying a linear step followed by the correct activation function.\n3.  For each layer, it caches the input `A`, weights `W`, bias `b`, and linear output `Z` for potential use in the backward pass.\n4.  The final activation `AL` is rounded to 4 decimal places and converted to a Python list before being returned along with the list of caches.\n\nThe code includes example usage at the end to demonstrate how to define the network parameters, input, and perform forward propagation. The final activation `AL` is printed as a result. \n\nHowever, according to the original task description, the output should be a tuple `(AL, caches)` where `AL` is the activation produced by the last layer. I adjusted the return type and docstring accordingly. \n\nThe output is now `(np.ndarray, list)`, a tuple of a numpy array and a list. The numpy array `AL` is the final activation and `caches` is the list of caches for each layer. \n\nThe function still returns `AL` rounded to 4 decimals and converted to a plain Python list via `ndarray.tolist()` but now it is returned as the first element of a tuple. \n\nMake sure to adjust the example usage according to your needs and the actual structure of your network parameters and input data."}

It handles sentences of varying lengths and replaces unseen words with the \"<UNK>\" token.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a sample corpus, sequence, and N-gram order. You can adjust the `corpus`, `sequence`, `N`, and `K` variables to test different inputs."}

It returns the reconstructed matrix `X_hat` rounded to 4 decimals.\n\nThe algorithm iteratively updates the factor matrices `W` and `H` by solving regularized least-squares problems. The loss is computed at each iteration, and the algorithm stops when the loss drops below the specified tolerance or when the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nIn the example usage, we create a random matrix `X` and perform ALS factorization with a target rank of 2. The reconstructed matrix `X_hat` is then printed to the console."}

If a cluster becomes empty, its centroid remains unchanged.\n4.  **Convergence Check**: The algorithm checks for convergence by comparing the old and new centroids. If they are the same, the algorithm stops.\n5.  **Result Processing**: Finally, the centroids are rounded to four decimal places and sorted in ascending order by their first coordinate.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `kmeans` function with a sample dataset."}

It supports three distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, and Cosine.\n\n1.  The `knn_predict` function takes in the training features `X`, training labels `y`, test features `X_test`, the number of neighbours `k`, and the distance metric.\n2.  It iterates over each test sample, computes distances to all training samples using the chosen metric, and selects the k closest neighbours.\n3.  The `majority_vote` function performs a majority vote on the labels of the k closest neighbours and returns the predicted label.\n4.  The predicted labels for all test samples are returned as a list.\n\nThe code includes example usage at the end, demonstrating how to generate random data, make predictions using the k-NN classifier, and print the predicted labels."}

If not, it returns -1.\n2.  **Initialization**: The code initializes the random number generator with the provided seed for reproducibility. It also defines the PSO parameters, such as the inertia weight `w`, cognitive weight `c1`, social weight `c2`, and the lower and upper bounds for the particle positions.\n3.  **Particle Initialization**: The particles' positions are initialized randomly within the specified bounds, and their velocities are set to zero. The particles' best positions and values are also initialized.\n4.  **Global Best Initialization**: The global best position and value are initialized based on the particles' initial positions and values.\n5.  **Optimization Iterations**: The code iterates over the specified number of iterations. In each iteration, it updates the velocity and position of each particle using the PSO update equations. The particles' best positions and values are updated if a better position is found.

It then iterates over each feature in the dataset and considers each unique value in the feature as a potential threshold for a binary split.\n3.  For each potential split, it calculates the Gini impurity of the left and right child nodes and then computes the weighted Gini impurity of the split.\n4.  The function keeps track of the best split found so far based on the weighted Gini impurity and tie-breaking rules.\n5.  If no valid split exists (e.g., every feature takes a constant value or all labels belong to one class), the function returns a tuple indicating that no valid split was found.\n\nThe code includes example usage at the end to demonstrate how to use the `best_gini_split` function with a sample dataset."}

In each iteration:\n\n    *   It evaluates all possible decision stumps by iterating over all features, thresholds, and polarities.\n    *   For each decision stump, it calculates the weighted classification error and the learner weight (`alpha`).\n    *   It selects the decision stump with the minimum error and updates the sample weights based on the misclassification.\n4.  **Ensemble Prediction**: After training all decision stumps, it uses the ensemble to predict labels for the test data `X_test`. The prediction is made by summing the weighted predictions of all decision stumps and taking the sign of the result.\n\nThe code includes an example usage section at the end, demonstrating how to train the AdaBoost model and make predictions on test data.\n\n## Note\n\nThe implementation assumes that the input data `X_train` and `X_test` are 2D numpy arrays, and the labels `y_train` are a 1D numpy array. The output predictions are a list of integers, each being either -1 or 1.\n\nThe decision stump is described by a tuple `(feature_index, threshold, polarity)`, where `feature_index` is the column in `X_train` that is inspected, `threshold` is the value that splits the data, and `polarity` (either 1 or -1) tells whether values lower than the threshold are classified as -1 or 1.\n\nThe code uses a simple example to illustrate the usage of the `adaboost_predict` function. You can replace this with your actual dataset and experiment with different parameters.\n\n## Future Improvements\n\n*   **Handling Edge Cases**: The current implementation assumes that the input data is well-formed and doesn't contain any edge cases. You may want to add error handling and checks for invalid inputs.\n*   **Optimizing Performance**: The implementation can be optimized for performance by using more efficient data structures and algorithms, especially for larger datasets.\n*   **Adding More Functionality**: You can extend the implementation to support more advanced features, such as handling missing values, using different types of weak learners, or incorporating regularization techniques."}

The `grad_check_RNN` function takes in a model, a loss function, a parameter name, the number of time-steps, an input array, and a small perturbation value. It returns the transposed numerical gradient of the chosen parameter.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `grad_check_RNN` function with a simple RNN model and a loss function. The `SimpleRNN` class represents a basic RNN model with a single layer, and the `loss_func` computes the mean squared error between predictions.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the model's `forward` method returns the prediction for one time-step, and the `flush_gradients` method resets any internally stored gradients. The `grad_check_RNN` function creates copies of the model and the parameter, perturbs the parameter, runs the forward loop, collects predictions, and approximates the partial derivative using the centred finite-difference formula.

For shapes with more than two dimensions, it considers the receptive field size as the product of all dimensions after the first two.\n\n3. **Standard Deviation Calculation**: The standard deviation `std_dev` is calculated using the formula `sqrt(2 / (fan_in + fan_out))`.\n\n4. **NumPy Array Generation**: The function generates a NumPy array with the specified shape, using `np.random.normal` to sample from a normal distribution with mean 0 and the calculated standard deviation.\n\n5. **Example Usage**: In the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, an example usage is provided. It generates a NumPy array with the specified shape, prints its shape and dtype, and calculates its mean and standard deviation to verify that they match the expected values.\n\n## Note\n\nThe `np.random.normal` function uses the global NumPy random state.

For each threshold, it splits the data into left and right subsets and calculates the information gain.\n4.  **Information Gain Calculation**: The information gain is calculated using the Shannon entropy of the parent node and the left and right child nodes.\n5.  **Updating Best Split**: If the current information gain is higher than the best gain found so far, the function updates the best threshold and gain.\n6.  **Returning Best Split or Default**: Finally, the function returns the best threshold and information gain, both rounded to 4 decimal places. If no positive information gain is found, it returns `(None, 0.0)`.\n\nThe code includes an example usage section at the end, demonstrating how to use the `best_split` function with sample feature and target data."}

If it is, the function returns the initializer; otherwise, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   The provided initializer functions (`zeros_init`, `ones_init`, and `random_uniform_init`) are implemented according to their descriptions.\n*   In the example usage, we demonstrate how to retrieve the `ones_init` function using `get_initializer` and apply it to a given shape.\n\n## Tests and Example Uses\n\nYou can test the `get_initializer` function with different initializer names and shapes:\n\n```python\n# Test zeros_init\ninit_fn = get_initializer(\"zeros_init\")\nprint(init_fn((2, 2))))\n\n# Test ones_init\ninit_fn = get_initializer(\"ones_init\")\nprint(init_fn((2, 2))))\n\n# Test random_uniform_init\ninit_fn = get_initializer(\"random_uniform_init\")\nprint(init_fn((2, 2), 0.0, 1.0))\n```\n\nThese tests will retrieve the corresponding initializer functions and apply them to generate matrices with zeros, ones, and random uniform values, respectively."}

For each transaction, it traverses the FP-Tree, updating or creating nodes as necessary.\n\nThe resulting FP-Tree is represented as a nested dictionary, where each node stores its support and children. The root node has a support of 0 and serves as the starting point for the tree.\n\n## Time Complexity\n\nThe time complexity of this solution can be broken down into several parts:\n\n*   Computing item supports: O(n \\* m), where n is the number of transactions and m is the average number of items per transaction.\n*   Sorting items by support and alphabetically: O(k log k), where k is the number of unique items.\n*   Constructing the FP-Tree: O(n \\* m \\* k), where n is the number of transactions, m is the average number of items per transaction, and k is the number of frequent items.\n\nOverall, the time complexity is dominated by the FP-Tree construction step, which is O(n \\* m \\* k).\n\n## Space Complexity\n\nThe space complexity is O(n \\* m + k), where n is the number of transactions, m is the average number of items per transaction, and k is the number of frequent items. This is because we need to store the FP-Tree and the item supports.\n\n## Example Use Case\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to construct an FP-Tree from a list of transactions with a minimum support threshold of 3. The output FP-Tree represents the frequent patterns in the given transactions.\n\nNote that the actual output FP-Tree may vary based on the input transactions and the specified minimum support threshold. The provided code constructs the FP-Tree according to the problem description and returns it as a nested dictionary."}

The function first converts the input lists `X` and `Y` to NumPy arrays for consistent processing.\n2. It checks if the number of columns in `X` and `Y` are compatible. If not, it returns -1.\n3.

It takes in a 2D NumPy array `data`, an integer `n_components`, and an optional string `solver` as inputs. The function first standardizes the data by subtracting the feature-wise mean. Then, it obtains the principal directions using either singular value decomposition (`svd`) or eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix (`eigen`). The principal directions are sorted in descending order of their importance, and the sign of every kept direction is made deterministic. Finally, the function projects the centred data onto the retained directions and returns the scores and explained variance ratio.\n\nThe code includes input validation, and it raises a `ValueError` if the solver is not `svd` or `eigen`. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `pca_transform` function with random data.\n\nThe output is rounded to 4 decimals and converted to Python built-ins (lists) before being returned. The scores are the projected data in the new sub-space, and the explained variance ratio represents the fraction of total variance explained by each selected component."}

This is achieved by reusing the `elu` function for the recursive calculation of `ELU(x, \u03b1)` in the gradient formula.\n*   Finally, the function rounds every element in the result to 4 decimal places and returns it as a Python list.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `elu` function to compute both the ELU activation and its gradient for a given input `x` and `alpha`."}

The GBDT model combines multiple weak models (CART regression trees) to create a strong predictive model.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The GBDT model starts with an initial prediction equal to the mean of the training targets.\n2.  **Boosting Iterations**: For each boosting iteration, the model computes the residuals (negative gradients of the squared-error loss), fits a CART regression tree of limited depth to those residuals, and updates the running prediction by adding the tree's output multiplied by the learning rate.\n3.  **CART Regression Tree**: The CART regression tree is implemented using a recursive approach. It finds the best split for each feature, evaluates the mean squared error (MSE) for each split, and chooses the split that results in the lowest MSE. The tree grows until it reaches the maximum depth or no further reduction in error is possible.\n4.  **Prediction**: The GBDT model predicts the target values for the test samples by summing the predictions from each CART regression tree, scaled by the learning rate.\n\nThe code includes an example usage section that demonstrates how to use the GBDT regressor with sample data.\n\nThe output of the GBDT regressor is a list of predicted values for every sample in `X_test`, rounded to 4 decimal places."}

The function first checks if the input data `X` is a 2D array and reshapes it if necessary.\n2.  It then verifies that the `mean` vector and `cov`ariance matrix have the correct shapes and that the covariance matrix is positive-definite (invertible).\n3.  The function calculates the determinant of the covariance matrix and its inverse, which are used in the PDF formula.\n4.  It iterates over each data point in `X`, computes the difference between the data point and the mean vector, and calculates the exponent term using the covariance matrix inverse.\n5.  Finally, it computes the PDF value for each data point using the multivariate Gaussian PDF formula and returns a list of PDF values rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `multivariate_gaussian_pdf` function with sample data points, a mean vector, and a covariance matrix. The resulting PDF values are printed to the console."}

The function `expected_sarsa_update` takes in the current Q-table, state, action, reward, next state, epsilon, learning rate, and discount factor as inputs and returns the updated Q-table.\n\nThe code first calculates the TD target based on the given inputs. If the next state is not `None`, it finds the greedy action(s) in the next state and calculates the expectation using the \u03b5-soft policy. The TD target is then calculated as the reward plus the discounted expectation. If the next state is `None`, the TD target is simply the reward.\n\nThe code then updates the Q entry using the TD error and the learning rate. Finally, it rounds every entry of the Q-table to 4 decimal places and returns the updated Q-table.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `expected_sarsa_update` function with sample inputs and print the updated Q-table."}

The function first initializes the estimated values for each arm with `ev_prior` and sets the pull counters to 0.\n2.  It then iterates over each time-step (row in the `rewards` matrix).\n3.  At each time-step, it chooses an arm with probability `epsilon` uniformly at random. Otherwise, it chooses the arm with the largest estimated value (breaking ties by the smallest index).\n4.  The function receives the reward for the chosen arm, updates the estimated value using the incremental sample mean formula, and increments the pull counter for the chosen arm.\n5.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The function starts by checking if the input data is empty. If it is, an empty list is returned. Otherwise, it initializes a list of cluster labels for all points to -1 (noise) and a cluster index to 0.\n2.  **Main Loop**: The function then iterates over each point in the data. If a point is already labeled, it skips to the next point.\n3.  **Neighborhood Search**: For each unlabeled point, it finds all neighboring points within the specified distance `eps`.\n4.  **Core Point Identification**: If the number of neighbors (including the point itself) is less than `min_samples`, the point is considered noise, and the function moves on to the next point.\n5.  **Cluster Formation**: If a point has at least `min_samples` neighbors, it is considered a core point and is labeled with the current cluster index. The function then uses a stack to iteratively label all reachable points with the same cluster index.\n6.  **Cluster Index Increment**: After processing all points in a cluster, the cluster index is incremented for the next cluster.\n7.  **Result**: Finally, the function returns a list of cluster labels for all points in the data.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to apply the `dbscan` function to sample data and print the resulting cluster labels."}

If `num_classes` is not provided, it is inferred as the maximum label value plus one. If `num_classes` is provided, the function checks if any label is out of range and raises a `ValueError` if necessary.\n\nThe function uses NumPy's `eye` function to create a one-hot encoded matrix. The `eye` function returns a 2D array with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

The algorithm works in two stages: FP-tree construction and recursive mining.\n\n1.  **FP-tree construction**: The code first counts the frequency of each item in the transactions and filters out items that do not meet the minimum support threshold. It then orders the remaining items in each transaction by their global frequency in descending order. The ordered transactions are used to construct an FP-tree, which is a prefix tree that stores the transactions in a compact and efficient manner. A header table is also created to keep track of the nodes in the FP-tree that contain each item.\n2.  **Recursive mining**: The code then performs recursive mining on the FP-tree to discover frequent item-sets. It starts by mining the header table to find frequent items, and then recursively generates conditional pattern bases and builds conditional FP-trees. The discovered item-sets are added to the result set.\n3.  **Post-processing and sorting**: Finally, the code sorts the frequent item-sets by their length and lexicographically, and returns the result.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `fp_growth` function to mine frequent item-sets from a collection of transactions with a minimum support threshold of 3. The output is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a frequent item-set in lexicographically sorted order."}

It first checks if `k` is within the valid range and returns `-1` if not. Then, it standardises each feature of the input data, computes the sample covariance matrix, performs an eigen-decomposition, sorts the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, fixes the sign of the eigenvectors, and projects the standardised data onto the first `k` eigenvectors. Finally, it rounds the projected data to four decimal places and returns it as a Python list.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `pca_transform` function with random data and `k=3`. You can replace the random data with your own dataset and adjust the value of `k` according to your needs."}

This allows for uniform processing of different input types (scalar, list/tuple, NumPy ndarray).\n2. **Input Clipping**: To prevent overflow for large input values, the function clips the input using `np.clip(z, -700, 700)`. This ensures that the input values are within a safe range for the sigmoid computation.\n3. **Sigmoid Computation**: The sigmoid values are computed using the numerically stable formula `1 / (1 + np.exp(-z_clipped))`.\n4. **Rounding**: The sigmoid values are rounded to four decimal places using `np.round(sigmoid_values, 4)`.\n5. **Output Handling**: If the input was a scalar, the function returns a float using `sigmoid_values.item()`.

It labels the core point, adds it to a queue, and then iteratively processes the queue. For each point in the queue, it labels its unlabeled neighbors and adds them to the queue if they are core points.\n5.  **Noise Point Labeling**: After processing all core points, any remaining unlabeled points are marked as noise with a label of -1.\n\nThe code returns a list of cluster labels for each sample, where cluster IDs start from 1, and noise points are labeled -1.

Initialize `alpha` and `b`: We start by initializing `alpha` as a vector of zeros with the same length as the number of training samples `N`, and `b` (the bias term) as 0.\n2.  Compute the Gram matrix `G`: The Gram matrix `G` is computed as the dot product of `X_data` with its transpose. This matrix represents the inner products between all pairs of feature vectors.\n3.  Iterate until convergence or max iterations: The algorithm iterates over the training data until either an entire pass produces no updates or the maximum number of iterations `max_iter` is reached.\n4.  Update `alpha` and `b`: For each sample, we compute `g` as the sum of the products of `alpha`, `y_data`, and the corresponding column of the Gram matrix. If the condition `y_i * (g + b) <= 0` is met, we update `alpha_i` and `b`.\n5.  Recover the weight vector `w`: After the iterations, we recover the weight vector `w` by summing the products of `alpha`, `y_data`, and `X_data` along the samples (axis 0).\n6.  Round and return: Finally, we round the components of `w` and `b` to 4 decimal places and return them as a tuple.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `perceptron_dual_train` function with some sample data and print the learned weight vector and bias term."}

The main function `detect_outliers` takes in a data matrix, the number of trees to build, the sample size for each tree, and the fraction of samples to consider as outliers.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The code starts by setting a global seed for reproducibility and checking if `epsilon` is 0. If so, it returns an empty list, as no object is allowed to be classified as an outlier.\n2.  **Isolation Tree Construction**: The `build_tree` function recursively constructs an isolation tree by splitting the data into left and right child nodes based on a random feature and threshold. The path length for each sample is computed, and the tree is grown until it reaches a specified height limit or contains only one sample.\n3.  **Path Length Computation**: The path length for each sample is computed by traversing the tree and calculating the distance from the root to the leaf node.\n4.  **Anomaly Scoring**: The average path length for each sample over all trees is computed and converted to an anomaly score using the formula `s(x) = 2^(-(h(x)/phi))`, where `h(x)` is the mean path length and `phi` is a normalization factor.\n5.  **Outlier Detection**: The samples are ranked based on their anomaly scores, and the top `\u03b5 * 100`% are identified as outliers.\n\nThe code includes an example usage section at the end, demonstrating how to call the `detect_outliers` function with a sample dataset and parameters.\n\n## Note\n\n*   The code assumes that the input data matrix `data` has shape `(n_samples, n_features)`.\n*   The Isolation Forest algorithm relies on randomness, so the results may vary slightly due to the random nature of the tree construction process.\n*   The `epsilon` value determines the fraction of samples to consider as outliers. A higher value of `epsilon` will result in more samples being classified as outliers.\n\nThe code implements a basic Isolation Forest algorithm for outlier detection and provides a clear example usage.

A list of distinct words along with their document-frequency ratios, ordered from most common to least common.\n2.  A set containing the *k* most common words, where *k* is specified by the `cut_off` parameter.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:\n\n*   **Count Total Documents**: The function starts by counting the total number of documents in the input data.\n*   **Word Frequency Counting**: It then creates a dictionary `word_frequencies` to store the frequency of each word across documents. The function iterates over each document, converts the words to a set to remove duplicates within a document, and increments the frequency for each unique word.\n*   **Document-Frequency Ratio Calculation**: The function calculates the document-frequency ratio for each word by dividing its frequency by the total number of documents and rounding the result to four decimal places.\n*   **Sorting Word Ratios**: The list of word ratios is sorted in descending order based on the ratios.\n*   **Determining Cut-off Index**: The function determines the cut-off index based on the provided `cut_off` parameter. If `cut_off` is `None` or larger than the number of distinct words, it includes all words. If `cut_off` is 0, it returns an empty set.\n*   **Most Frequent Words Set**: Finally, the function creates a set of the most frequent words based on the cut-off index and returns the list of word ratios and the set of most frequent words.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `statistic_key_word` function with a sample dataset and print the resulting word ratios and most frequent words."}

It calculates the LOF scores for each data point and identifies those points whose score exceeds a specified threshold, epsilon. \n\nThe LOF algorithm is a density-based method for outlier detection. The algorithm works by comparing the local density of a point with the densities of its neighbors. Points with a significantly lower local density than their neighbors are considered outliers.\n\n## Key Improvements:\n\n1. **Efficient Distance Computation**: The code uses NumPy's vectorized operations to efficiently compute the pairwise Euclidean distance matrix.\n\n2. **Accurate LOF Score Calculation**: The LOF scores are accurately calculated based on the provided formula, ensuring that the scores reflect the local outlier factor of each data point.\n\n3. **Proper Handling of k-Nearest Neighbors**: The implementation correctly identifies the k-nearest neighbors for each data point and uses them to compute the LRD and LOF scores.\n\n4. **Clear and Readable Structure**: The code is organized into clear sections, making it easier to understand and follow.\n\n## Notes:\n\n*   The LOF algorithm is sensitive to the choice of k and epsilon. These parameters should be carefully selected based on the characteristics of the dataset.\n*   The provided implementation assumes that the input data is a NumPy array. If the data is in a different format, it may need to be converted before processing.\n*   The code includes example usage and prints the LOF scores and outlier indices for a sample dataset. \n\nThe code provided implements the LOF algorithm from scratch, following the steps outlined in the task description, and returns a tuple consisting of the list of LOF scores rounded to four decimals and the ascending list of indices of all samples whose LOF score is strictly larger than epsilon. \n\nPlease ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., NumPy) to run the code. \n\nAlso, note that the LOF algorithm can be computationally expensive for large datasets due to the pairwise distance calculations. \n\nTherefore, for very large datasets, consider using optimized libraries or more efficient algorithms for outlier detection. \n\nIn addition, the choice of k and epsilon can significantly impact the results, and these parameters may need to be adjusted based on the specific characteristics of your dataset. \n\nThe code is designed to be readable, maintainable, and efficient, with clear documentation and example usage. \n\nIt can be easily integrated into existing projects or used as a standalone tool for outlier detection. \n\nMake sure to test it thoroughly with your specific use case and dataset. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel"}

If the network has one output neuron, return a float; otherwise, return a list of floats.\n\nCritical details:\n\n* The bias term should be added to the input vector x before performing the dot product with the weight matrix.\n* The ReLU activation function should be applied element-wise to the output of each hidden layer.\n* The output layer has linear activation, which means no activation function is applied.\n\nOptimizations or special cases:\n\n* None mentioned in the original trace.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef neural_net_predict(weights: list[list[list[float]]], x: list[float]) -> float | list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Perform a forward pass through a fully-connected ReLU neural network.\n\n    The network topology and parameters are encoded in *weights* where:\n      \u2022 *weights[L]* \u2013 weight matrix of layer L,\n      \u2022 each *weights[L][i]* \u2013 list of weights of neuron i of layer L,\n      \u2022 the first weight of every neuron is its bias weight.\n\n    All hidden layers use ReLU, the last layer is linear.\n\n    Args:\n        weights: A three-level nested list containing the network\u2019s weights.\n        x:       Input feature vector (without the bias term).\n\n    Returns:\n        The prediction rounded to four decimals (float if the output layer has\n        one neuron, otherwise list of floats).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Add bias term to input vector\n    x = [1] + x\n    \n    # Iterate over layers\n    for i, layer_weights in enumerate(weights):\n        # Initialize output of current layer\n        layer_output = []\n        \n        # Iterate over neurons in current layer\n        for neuron_weights in layer_weights:\n            # Compute weighted sum including bias\n            weighted_sum = np.dot(x, neuron_weights)\n            \n            # Apply ReLU activation for hidden layers\n            if i < len(weights) - 1:\n                layer_output.append(max(0, weighted_sum))\n            else:\n                layer_output.append(weighted_sum)\n        \n        # Update input for next layer\n        x = layer_output\n    \n    # Round result to four decimals and return\n    if len(x) == 1:\n        return round(x[0], 4)\n    else:\n        return [round(val, 4) for val in x]\n```"}
