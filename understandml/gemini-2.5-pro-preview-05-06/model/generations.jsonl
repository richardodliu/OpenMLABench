{"task_id": 0, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement Ridge Linear Regression using its closed-form solution, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prepare the Data**:\n    *   Separate the input `data` ndarray into the feature matrix $\\mathbf X_{original}$ (all columns except the last) and the target vector $\\mathbf y$ (the last column).\n    *   Ensure $\\mathbf y$ is a column vector for matrix operations.\n    *   Handle the case where `data` might be a 1D array (representing a single sample) by reshaping it into a 2D array with one row.\n\n2.  **Add Bias Term**:\n    *   A bias (or intercept) term is added to the feature matrix. This is done by prepending a column of ones to $\\mathbf X_{original}$ to form the design matrix $\\mathbf X$ (referred to as `X_bias` in the code). The number of rows in this column of ones is equal to the number of samples.\n\n3.  **Formulate Matrices for the Closed-Form Solution**:\n    *   The closed-form solution for Ridge Regression is $\\hat\\mathbf w=(\\mathbf X^\\top\\mathbf X+\\alpha\\,\\mathbf I)^{-1}\\,\\mathbf X^\\top\\mathbf y$.\n    *   Let $d$ be the number of columns in `X_bias` (i.e., number of original features + 1 for bias).\n    *   Compute $\\mathbf X^\\top\\mathbf X$ ( `X_bias.T @ X_bias`).\n    *   Create an identity matrix $\\mathbf I$ of size $d \\times d$.\n    *   Compute the matrix $\\mathbf A = (\\mathbf X^\\top\\mathbf X + \\alpha\\mathbf I)$.\n\n4.  **Check for Invertibility**:\n    *   Calculate the determinant of $\\mathbf A$.\n    *   If the numerical determinant is close to zero (using `np.isclose(np.linalg.det(A), 0.0)` for robustness with floating-point numbers), the matrix $\\mathbf A$ is considered singular. In this case, return -1 as per the problem requirement.\n\n5.  **Compute Weights**:\n    *   If $\\mathbf A$ is invertible, compute its inverse $\\mathbf A^{-1}$. A `try-except np.linalg.LinAlgError` block is used for robustness, as `np.linalg.inv()` can fail for ill-conditioned matrices even if the determinant is not exactly zero.\n    *   Compute $\\mathbf X^\\top\\mathbf y$ (`X_bias.T @ y_vec`).\n    *   Calculate the weight vector $\\hat\\mathbf w = \\mathbf A^{-1} (\\mathbf X^\\top\\mathbf y)$.\n\n6.  **Format Output**:\n    *   The resulting weight vector $\\hat\\mathbf w$ (which includes the bias term as its first element) is a NumPy array.\n    *   Round each coefficient in $\\hat\\mathbf w$ to 4 decimal places using `np.round()`.\n    *   Convert the rounded NumPy array to a Python list.\n\nThe regularization strength $\\alpha$ must be non-negative ($\\alpha \\ge 0$). If $\\alpha = 0$, Ridge Regression reduces to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression. If $\\alpha > 0$, the term $\\alpha\\mathbf I$ helps to make the matrix $(\\mathbf X^\\top\\mathbf X+\\alpha\\,\\mathbf I)$ invertible and well-conditioned, especially if $\\mathbf X^\\top\\mathbf X$ is singular or near-singular (e.g., due to multicollinearity or more features than samples).\n\nThe implementation assumes that the input `data` array has at least one column (the target $\\mathbf y$), as per the problem description.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n# from typing import List, Union # If allowed to modify signature for Union[List[float], int]\n\n# Sticking to the provided signature:\ndef ridge_regression(data: np.ndarray, alpha: float = 0.0) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements Ridge (L2-regularised) Linear Regression using its closed-form solution.\n\n    Given an ndarray `data` where the last column is the target `y` and all\n    preceding columns are the features `X`, this function adds a bias (intercept)\n    term to `X`, then computes the weight vector `w_hat` using the formula:\n\n        w_hat = (X_bias^T X_bias + alpha * I)^-1 * X_bias^T y\n\n    where `X_bias` is the feature matrix with the bias term included, `alpha` is the\n    regularisation strength (>=0), and `I` is the identity matrix whose size\n    is the number of columns in `X_bias`.\n\n    Args:\n        data: A NumPy ndarray.

{"task_id": 1, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "The dual-form perceptron algorithm learns a linear classifier by updating dual parameters `\u03b1\u1d62` instead of directly updating the primal weight vector `w`. The weight vector `w` is expressed as a linear combination of training samples: `w = \u03a3\u1d62 \u03b1\u1d62 y\u1d62 x\u1d62`. All computations involving training samples `x` occur through inner products `K(x\u1d62, x\u2c7c) = x\u1d62 \u00b7 x\u2c7c`, which are typically precomputed and stored in a Gram matrix.\n\nThe learning process follows these steps:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   The dual parameters `\u03b1` (a vector of size `n_samples`) are initialized to zeros.\n    *   The bias `b` is initialized to zero.\n    *   The Gram matrix `K` is precomputed, where `K[j, i] = X_train[j] \u00b7 X_train[i]`.\n\n2.  **Training Loop**:\n    *   The algorithm iterates through the training samples. A variable, `current_sample_idx`, tracks the index of the sample being processed.\n    *   For each sample `x_i` (where `i` is `current_sample_idx`):\n        *   The activation is computed as: `activation = \u03a3\u2c7c \u03b1\u2c7c y\u2c7c K(x\u2c7c, x\u1d62)`. This sum is over all training samples `j`.\n        *   The margin is checked: `margin = y\u1d62 * (activation + b)`.\n        *   If `margin \u2264 0`, the sample `x_i` is misclassified. The updates are:\n            *   `\u03b1\u1d62 \u2190 \u03b1\u1d62 + \u03b7` (where `\u03b7` is the learning rate)\n            *   `b \u2190 b + \u03b7 y\u1d62`\n            *   The count of total updates is incremented.\n            *   Crucially, **the scan is restarted from the first sample** (`current_sample_idx` is reset to 0).\n        *   If `margin > 0`, the sample is correctly classified. The algorithm proceeds to the next sample (`current_sample_idx` is incremented).\n\n3.  **Stopping Conditions**:\n    *   The training stops if an entire pass (scan) through all `n_samples` is completed without any updates, indicating convergence.\n    *   Alternatively, training stops if the total number of updates reaches a predefined maximum `n_iter`, which prevents infinite loops on non-linearly separable data.\n\n4.  **Final Weights**:\n    *   After training, the primal weight vector `w` is computed from the final `\u03b1` values using `w = \u03a3\u1d62 \u03b1\u1d62 y\u1d62 x\u1d62`.\n\n5.  **Output**:\n    *   The components of `w` and the scalar `b` are rounded to four decimal places. `w` is returned as a list.\n\nThe implementation uses NumPy for efficient array operations, particularly for calculating the Gram matrix and the summations involved in activation and final weight computation. Edge cases like empty training sets are handled. The \"restart scan\" logic is implemented by resetting `current_sample_idx` to 0 upon an update, and convergence is detected by tracking `no_update_streak` across samples.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef perceptron_dual(X_train: np.ndarray,\n                    y_train: np.ndarray,\n                    eta: float = 1.0,\n                    n_iter: int = 10000) -> tuple[list[float], float]:\n    \"\"\"Dual-form perceptron.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X_train : np.ndarray\n        Training samples of shape (n_samples, n_features).\n    y_train : np.ndarray\n        Binary labels (+1 or \u20111) of length n_samples.\n    eta : float, optional\n        Learning rate, by default 1.0.\n    n_iter : int, optional\n        Maximum number of updates, by default 10 000.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple[list[float], float]\n        The weight vector (as a list) and the bias; both rounded to 4 decimals.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_samples, n_features = X_train.shape\n\n    # Handle empty training set case\n    if n_samples == 0:\n        w_vec = np.zeros(n_features) # w will be all zeros\n        b = 0.0\n        w_rounded = [round(val, 4) for val in w_vec]\n        b_rounded = round(b, 4)\n        return w_rounded, b_rounded\n\n    # 1.

{"task_id": 3, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the `isolation_tree_path_length` function, we will follow the specified rules for growing an isolation tree and then determine the depth of the leaf node for each sample.\n\nThe core of the solution will be a recursive helper function, say `_recursive_build`, that takes the current set of sample indices and the current depth as input.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the logic within the recursive function:\n\n1.  **Seed Initialization**: `numpy.random.seed(0)` will be called once at the beginning of the `isolation_tree_path_length` function to ensure reproducibility of random choices (feature selection and split value selection).\n\n2.  **Base Cases for Leaves**:\n    *   **Minimum Samples**: If the number of samples reaching the current node (`len(current_indices)`) is less than 3, this node becomes a leaf. The depth for all samples in `current_indices` is recorded as `current_depth`.\n    *   **No Features**: If the input `data` has zero features (`data.shape[1] == 0`), no splits are possible. All samples effectively form a leaf at the current depth.\n    *   **Indistinguishable Samples for Chosen Feature**: After selecting a feature `f`, if all samples in `current_indices` have the same value for this feature (`min_val == max_val`), they cannot be split further by this feature. The node becomes a leaf, and their depth is `current_depth`.\n    *   **Ineffective Split**: If a split is attempted (i.e., `min_val < max_val`), but all samples fall into one child (either left or right is empty), the split is ineffective. The node becomes a leaf, and samples take `current_depth`. This prevents infinite recursion if, for example, the `split_val` is chosen such that all samples are `<= split_val`.\n\n3.  **Recursive Step (Splitting the Node)**:\n    *   If none of the leaf conditions are met, a split is performed:\n        *   A feature index `f` is chosen uniformly at random from the available features.\n        *   The minimum (`down`) and maximum (`up`) values of feature `f` among the `current_indices` are determined.\n        *   A split value `v` is drawn uniformly from the range `[down, up)`. Note: `numpy.random.uniform(down, up)` samples from `[down, up)`. If `down == up`, it returns `down`. However, we've already handled the `down == up` case by making it a leaf.\n        *   Samples are partitioned: those with `data[sample, f] <= v` go to the left child, and others (`data[sample, f] > v`) go to the right child.\n    *   The `_recursive_build` function is then called for the left and right children with `current_depth + 1`.\n\n4.  **Storing Depths**: A list, `depths_result`, initialized for all samples, will store the final depth for each sample. When a sample `i` ends up in a leaf at depth `d`, `depths_result[i]` is set to `d`.\n\n5.  **Initial Call**: The process starts by calling `_recursive_build` with all sample indices (`list(range(n_samples))`) and an initial depth of `0`.\n\nThe input `data` is specified as a 2-D NumPy array. The function will handle cases like an empty dataset (`n_samples = 0`).\n\nThe provided redundant imports (`numpy` and `Counter` imported twice) will be kept as per the problem's starting template. `Counter` itself is not used in this solution.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef isolation_tree_path_length(data: np.ndarray) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Compute the depth of the leaf reached by every sample in a random isolation tree.\n\n    The tree is built following the rules described in the task statement and the\n    random seed must be set to 0 so that results are reproducible.\n\n    Args:\n        data: A 2-D NumPy array of shape (n_samples, n_features).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of length *n_samples* where the *i-th* element is the number of\n        edges from the root to the leaf that contains the *i-th* sample.\n    \"\"\"\n    np.random.seed(0)  # Set seed for reproducibility\n\n    n_samples = data.shape[0]\n    if n_samples == 0:\n        return []\n    \n    # Initialize depths for all samples.

{"task_id": 7, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "The problem asks us to implement frequent itemset mining. Given a list of transactions and a minimum support threshold (`minsup`), we need to find all itemsets that appear in at least `ceil(minsup * N)` transactions, where `N` is the total number of transactions. The result should be a dictionary mapping each frequent itemset (represented as a sorted tuple) to its absolute support count.\n\nThis task can be solved using the Apriori algorithm, which works iteratively:\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Calculate `N`, the total number of transactions. If `N` is 0, return an empty dictionary.\n    *   Calculate the minimum absolute support count: `min_support_count = ceil(minsup * N)`.\n    *   Pre-process transactions: Convert each transaction (list of items) into a set of unique items. This handles duplicates within a transaction as per the problem definition and allows for efficient subset checking.\n\n2.  **Find Frequent 1-Itemsets (L1)**:\n    *   Scan all processed transactions to count the occurrences of each individual item.\n    *   Any item whose count is greater than or equal to `min_support_count` forms a frequent 1-itemset.\n    *   Store these 1-itemsets (as tuples, e.g., `('bread',)`) and their counts in the final result dictionary.\n    *   The set of these frequent 1-itemsets forms `L1`. If `L1` is empty, no larger frequent itemsets can exist, so return the (empty) results.\n\n3.  **Iteratively Generate Frequent k-Itemsets (Lk) from L(k-1)**:\n    *   Start with `k = 2`.\n    *   The loop continues as long as frequent itemsets were found in the previous step (i.e., `L(k-1)` is not empty).\n    *   **Candidate Generation (Ck)**:\n        *   Generate candidate k-itemsets from `L(k-1)` (the set of frequent (k-1)-itemsets). A common method (F_k-1 x F_k-1) is to join two frequent (k-1)-itemsets if they share the first `k-2` items. For example, if `(item1, item2)` and `(item1, item3)` are in `L2`, then `(item1, item2, item3)` becomes a candidate for `C3`. To do this efficiently, the itemsets in `L(k-1)` are first sorted lexicographically. Then, pairs `(s1, s2)` from `L(k-1)` are considered. If `s1[:-1] == s2[:-1]` (meaning their first `k-2` items are identical) and `s1[-1] < s2[-1]` (ensuring ordered combination and sorted output), then `s1 + (s2[-1],)` forms a candidate k-itemset. This construction ensures candidates are sorted tuples.\n    *   **Pruning (Apriori Property)**:\n        *   For each candidate k-itemset generated, verify that all of its (k-1)-subsets are frequent (i.e., present in `L(k-1)`). If any (k-1)-subset is not in `L(k-1)`, the candidate cannot be frequent and is pruned. `itertools.combinations` can be used to generate these subsets.\n    *   **Support Counting**:\n        *   For each remaining (pruned) candidate k-itemset, scan the processed transactions to count how many transactions contain this itemset. An itemset is contained in a transaction if all items of the itemset are present in the transaction set.\n    *   **Filtering (Lk)**:\n        *   From the counted candidates, select those whose support count is greater than or equal to `min_support_count`. These form `Lk`, the set of frequent k-itemsets.\n        *   Add these frequent k-itemsets and their counts to the final result dictionary.\n    *   If `Lk` is empty, it means no frequent k-itemsets were found, so no larger itemsets can be frequent. The algorithm terminates.\n    *   Otherwise, set `L(k-1) = Lk`, increment `k`, and repeat the process to find `L(k+1)`.\n\n4.  **Return Results**:\n    *   The accumulated dictionary of all frequent itemsets (L1, L2, ..., Lk_max) and their counts is returned.\n\nThis approach ensures that itemsets are stored as sorted tuples and adheres to the problem's constraints, including not using third-party libraries.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Tuple, Hashable\n\ndef find_frequent_itemsets(transactions: List[List[Hashable]], minsup: float) -> Dict[Tuple[Hashable, ...], int]:\n    \"\"\"Return all frequent itemsets in **transactions**.\n\n    Args:\n        transactions: List where each element represents a transaction and is\n                       itself a list of items (hashable Python objects).\n        minsup:       Minimum support given as a fraction between 0 and 1.\n                      Must be 0 < minsup <= 1.\n\n    Returns:\n        A dictionary that maps every frequent itemset (stored as a tuple of\n        sorted items) to its absolute support count.

{"task_id": 11, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Validate input parameters (`data`, `k`).\n    *   Select the first `k` samples from the `data` array as the initial cluster centers. These centers are converted to `float` type to ensure precision during mean calculations.\n\n2.  **Iterative Process**:\n    The algorithm then enters a loop that continues until convergence criteria are met or the maximum number of iterations (`max_iter`) is reached. Each iteration consists of two main steps:\n\n    *   **Assignment Step**:\n        *   For each sample in the dataset, calculate its squared Euclidean distance to every cluster center.\n        *   Assign the sample to the cluster whose center is nearest. This is done efficiently using NumPy's broadcasting capabilities to compute all distances in a vectorized manner. The resulting assignments (labels) are stored.\n\n    *   **Update Step**:\n        *   For each cluster, recompute its center as the arithmetic mean of all samples assigned to it.\n        *   **Handling Empty Clusters**: If a cluster becomes empty (i.e., no samples are assigned to it), its center is re-initialized by picking a random sample from the original dataset. This ensures that the algorithm maintains `k` clusters throughout the process. `np.random.randint` is used for this random selection.\n\n3.  **Convergence Check**:\n    *   After updating the centers, compare them to the centers from the previous iteration.\n    *   Calculate the Euclidean distance each center has moved.\n    *   The algorithm converges if the maximum distance any center has moved is less than a predefined threshold `epsilon`.\n    *   If convergence is achieved or `max_iter` is reached, the loop terminates.\n\n4.  **Output Formatting**:\n    *   Once the algorithm has converged, the coordinates of the final cluster centers are rounded to 4 decimal places.\n    *   The centers (now a list of lists of floats) and the list of cluster labels for each sample are returned.\n\nThe implementation avoids using any external machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and does not use object-oriented programming (classes), adhering to the problem requirements.

{"task_id": 19, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To find the best split (feature_index, threshold) for a gradient-boosting tree node, we need to iterate through all possible splits and select the one that maximizes the gain.

Calculate \\(G_{\\mathcal{I}}\\) and \\(H_{\\mathcal{I}}\\) for all instances in the current node. From this, calculate \\(S(\\mathcal{I})\\).\n2.  Initialize `max_gain = 0.0` and `best_split_info = None`. A split is only chosen if its gain is strictly positive.\n3.  For each feature:\n    a.  Sort the instances based on the values of this feature. Keep the corresponding `g` and `h` values aligned with the sorted feature values.\n    b.  Iterate through the sorted instances to find potential split points. A split point occurs between `sorted_feature_values[i]` and `sorted_feature_values[i+1]`.\n    c.  The threshold is taken as `sorted_feature_values[i]`. Instances with feature value \\(\\le\\) threshold go to the left child (\\(\\mathcal{I}_L\\)), and instances with feature value \\(>\\) threshold go to the right child (\\(\\mathcal{I}_R\\)).\n    d.  To efficiently calculate \\(G_{\\mathcal{I}_L}, H_{\\mathcal{I}_L}, G_{\\mathcal{I}_R}, H_{\\mathcal{I}_R}\\):\n        i.  Initialize \\(G_L = 0, H_L = 0\\).\n        ii. In each step of the iteration, add the `g` and `h` of the current instance `i` (from the sorted list) to \\(G_L\\) and \\(H_L\\).\n        iii.Then, \\(G_R = G_{\\mathcal{I}} - G_L\\) and \\(H_R = H_{\\mathcal{I}} - H_L\\).\n    e.  A split is considered only if `sorted_feature_values[i] < sorted_feature_values[i+1]`. This ensures that the threshold actually separates distinct values and avoids redundant calculations for sequences of identical feature values.\n    f.  A split must be valid: at least two training instances must be on each side (\\(|\\mathcal{I}_L| \\ge 2\\) and \\(|\\mathcal{I}_R| \\ge 2\\)).\n    g.  If the split is valid, calculate its gain using the formula.\n    h.  If the calculated gain is greater than `max_gain`, update `max_gain` and store the current `(feature_index, threshold)` as `best_split_info`.\n4.  After checking all features and all possible thresholds, if `best_split_info` is not `None` (i.e., a split with positive gain was found), return it. Otherwise, return `None`.\n\nNumerical stability: Denominators like \\(H + \\lambda\\) should not be zero or negative. A small epsilon is used to check this; if a denominator is too small (e.g., \\(\\le 10^{-9}\\)), the corresponding term might be unstable or infinite, so such splits (or even splitting the parent node) are avoided.\n\nEdge cases:\n*   If the total number of samples `n_samples` is less than 4, no valid split satisfying the \"at least two on each side\" rule can be made.\n*   If, for a feature, all values are identical, no split can be made on that feature.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef best_split(X: np.ndarray,\n               g: np.ndarray,\n               h: np.ndarray,\n               gamma: float,\n               lam: float) -> tuple[int, float] | None:\n    \"\"\"Return the best (feature, threshold) split for a tree node.\n\n    The split is chosen to maximise the reduction in the regularised loss used\n    by gradient-boosting decision-trees.

{"task_id": 21, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement AdaBoost with one-dimensional decision stumps, we will follow the specified algorithm steps:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Convert input lists (`x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`) to NumPy arrays for efficient computation.\n    *   Handle the edge case of an empty training set (`n_train == 0`). In this scenario, we'll return a default prediction (e.g., all +1s) for the test set.\n    *   Initialize sample weights `w_i` uniformly: `w_i = 1/n_train` for all `i`.\n    *   Prepare lists to store the `alpha` coefficients and parameters of the chosen stumps.\n\n2.  **Threshold Generation**:\n    *   Identify unique sorted values from `x_train`.\n    *   Generate candidate thresholds `\u03b8` by taking the midpoint between every two consecutive unique sorted training points: `\u03b8 = (x_j + x_{j+1}) / 2`. If there are fewer than two unique points, no thresholds are generated by this rule.\n\n3.  **AdaBoost Iterations**:\n    *   The main loop continues until the training error of the current ensemble is less than or equal to the user-supplied `epsilon`.\n    *   **Stopping Conditions**:\n        *   Primary: Ensemble training error `\u2264 epsilon`.\n        *   Secondary: If no thresholds were generated (e.g., `x_train` has fewer than 2 unique values), no stumps can be formed, so training stops.\n        *   Secondary: If the best stump found has an error of 0.5, its `alpha` will be 0. This means it adds no information, and weights won't change, potentially leading to an infinite loop if the error condition isn't met. We break if `alpha` is effectively zero.\n        *   Secondary: If weights sum to near zero (e.g., due to a perfect stump making all weights tiny), normalization fails or becomes unstable. We break in this case.\n\n    *   **Inside the Loop**:\n        a.  **Calculate Ensemble Training Error**: Before finding a new stump, calculate the training error of the ensemble formed by stumps chosen so far. If this error `\u2264 epsilon`, terminate training. For the first iteration (empty ensemble), the convention is often to predict all +1s.\n        b.  **Find Best Stump**:\n            *   Iterate through all possible decision stumps. A stump is defined by `(d, \u03b8)`:\n                *   `d = 0`: Predicts +1 if sample value `x \u2264 \u03b8`, \u20131 otherwise.\n                *   `d = 1`: Predicts +1 if sample value `x > \u03b8`, \u20131 otherwise.\n            *   For each stump, calculate its predictions `h(x_i)` on the training set.\n            *   Compute the weighted error: `err = \u03a3 w_i * I(h(x_i) \u2260 y_i)`, where `I(...)` is the indicator function. Since weights are normalized (`\u03a3 w_i = 1`), this sum is the error.\n            *   Select the stump `(d*, \u03b8*)` with the minimum `err`.\n        c.  **Compute Alpha (\u03b1)**:\n            *   Calculate `\u03b1 = 0.5 * ln((1 \u2013 err) / err)`.\n            *   To handle `err` being very close to 0 or 1 (which would make `\u03b1` infinite or cause `log(0)`), `err` is clamped to a small range `[stability_eps, 1 - stability_eps]`. This makes `\u03b1` large but finite.\n        d.  **Store Stump and Alpha**: Add `\u03b1` and `(d*, \u03b8*)` to their respective lists.\n        e.  **Update Sample Weights**:\n            *   `w_i \u2190 w_i * exp(\u2013\u03b1 * y_i * h*(x_i))`.\n            *   Normalize weights: `w_i \u2190 w_i / \u03a3 w_j`.\n\n4.  **Prediction on Test Set**:\n    *   After the training loop terminates, use the stored `alphas` and `stumps` to make predictions on `x_test`.\n    *   The final prediction for a test point `x` is `sign( \u03a3 \u03b1_t * h_t(x) )`.\n    *   If the sum is 0, `sign(0)` is conventionally taken as +1.\n    *   If no stumps were selected during training (e.g., initial error was low, or no thresholds), the ensemble is empty. In this case, predict +1 for all test samples.\n\nA small constant `stability_eps` (e.g., `1e-12`) is used to prevent numerical issues like division by zero, `log(0)`, or `exp(overflow)` during `alpha` calculation and weight updates.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef adaboost_1d_predict(x_train: list[float],\n                        y_train: list[int],\n                        x_test: list[float],\n                        epsilon: float = 0.0) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Trains a 1-D AdaBoost ensemble and returns predictions.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x_train : list[float]\n        Training sample values (one-dimensional).\n    y_train : list[int]\n        Labels corresponding to *x_train* (each value must be 1 or \u20131).\n    x_test : list[float]\n        Sample values to classify after training.\n    epsilon : float, default 0.0\n        Upper bound on the allowed training error.

{"task_id": 25, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the Gaussian SVM prediction, we need to compute the decision function `g(z)` for each test sample `z` and then determine the class label using `sign(g(z))`. The decision function is given by:\n`g(z) = \u03a3_{i=1..n} \u03b1_i \u00b7 y_i \u00b7 exp( \u2212\u03b3 \u00b7 ||x_i \u2212 z||\u00b2 )  +  b`\n\nThe implementation will be vectorized using NumPy for efficiency. Here's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1.  **Handle Edge Cases**:\n    *   If there are no test samples (`m=0`), return an empty list.\n    *   If there are no training samples (`n=0`), the sum term in `g(z)` becomes zero. So, `g(z) = b`. The prediction for all test samples will be `sign(b)`. If `b=0`, `sign(0)=0`, which we'll map to `1` as per the output constraints.\n\n2.  **Precompute `\u03b1_i \u00b7 y_i`**:\n    The term `\u03b1_i \u00b7 y_i` is used for each training sample `x_i`. We can precompute this product as a vector `alpha_y` of length `n`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Pairwise Squared Euclidean Distances**:\n    We need `||x_i \u2212 z_j||\u00b2` for all training samples `x_i` and test samples `z_j`. This can be efficiently computed using the identity:\n    `||x_i \u2212 z_j||\u00b2 = ||x_i||\u00b2 - 2 \u00b7 x_i^T \u00b7 z_j + ||z_j||\u00b2`\n    *   Compute squared norms for all `x_i`: `sum_X_sq[i] = ||x_i||\u00b2`.\n    *   Compute squared norms for all `z_j`: `sum_Z_sq[j] = ||z_j||\u00b2`.\n    *   Compute all dot products `P[i,j] = x_i^T \u00b7 z_j`. This is `X_train @ X_test.T`.\n    *   The matrix of squared distances `D[i,j] = ||x_i \u2212 z_j||\u00b2` can then be found using broadcasting: `D = sum_X_sq[:, np.newaxis] - 2 * P + sum_Z_sq[np.newaxis, :]`. `D` will have shape `(n, m)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Gaussian Kernel Matrix**:\n    The kernel `K(x_i, z_j) = exp( \u2212\u03b3 \u00b7 ||x_i \u2212 z_j||\u00b2 )`. Apply this element-wise to the `sq_dists` matrix: `kernel_matrix = np.exp(-gamma * sq_dists)`. This matrix also has shape `(n, m)`.\n\n5.  **Compute Decision Function Values**:\n    The sum `\u03a3_{i=1..n} \u03b1_i \u00b7 y_i \u00b7 K(x_i, z_j)` for each `z_j` can be computed by a dot product: `sum_vector = alpha_y @ kernel_matrix`. This results in a vector of length `m`, where `sum_vector[j]` is the sum for `z_j`.\n    Then, add the bias term: `decision_values = sum_vector + b`.\n\n6.  **Determine Predicted Labels**:\n    The predicted label for `z_j` is `sign(decision_values[j])`.\n    `np.sign()` returns `0` for an input of `0`. The problem requires labels to be strictly `1` or `-1`. We will map `0` to `1` (a common convention).\n\n7.  **Format Output**:\n    Convert the NumPy array of predicted labels (which will be floats like `1.0`, `-1.0`) into a Python `list` of `int`s.\n\nThis approach is fully vectorized as it uses NumPy's array operations and avoids explicit Python loops over the training or test samples for the core computations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n# math module is allowed but not strictly necessary as np.exp is used.\n# import math # No specific math functions are needed beyond what numpy provides.\n\ndef gaussian_svm_predict(X_train: np.ndarray,\n                         y_train: np.ndarray,\n                         alpha: np.ndarray,\n                         b: float,\n                         gamma: float,\n                         X_test: np.ndarray) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Predict labels for test samples using a Gaussian-kernel SVM.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X_train : numpy.ndarray\n        The (n, d) matrix of training samples used to fit the SVM.\n    y_train : numpy.ndarray\n        The length-n vector of training labels.

{"task_id": 28, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "An autoencoder aims to reconstruct its input. For a linear autoencoder with a bottleneck of \\(k\\) latent dimensions, the optimal reconstruction (minimizing mean squared error) is achieved by using a truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the input data matrix \\(X\\). Specifically, if \\(X \\approx U_k S_k V_k^T\\) is the rank-\\(k\\) SVD approximation, this corresponds to projecting the data onto the subspace spanned by the first \\(k\\) principal components.\n\nThe process involves these steps:\n1.  **Input Validation**:\n    *   The input list of lists `X` is converted to a NumPy array `X_np` with `float` data type. Robust checks are performed to ensure `X` represents a valid \\(m \\times n\\) matrix. If `X` is malformed (e.g., ragged list, 1D list instead of list of lists), or if `np.array` conversion fails, the function returns -1.\n    *   The dimensions \\(m\\) (rows) and \\(n\\) (columns) are determined from `X_np`. Special handling is included for an empty input `X = []`, which results in \\(m=0, n=0\\).\n    *   The number of latent dimensions `k` is validated. It must satisfy \\(1 \\le k \\le \\min(m, n)\\).

This yields:\n        *   `U`: An \\(m \\times p\\) matrix whose columns are the left singular vectors.\n        *   `s_vec`: A 1D array of length \\(p\\) containing the singular values in descending order.\n        *   `Vh`: A \\(p \\times n\\) matrix whose rows are the right singular vectors (i.e., \\(V^T\\)).\n        Here, \\(p = \\min(m, n)\\).\n    *   To obtain the rank-\\(k\\) approximation \\(\\hat{X}\\), we select the first \\(k\\) components:\n        *   `U_k = U[:, :k]` (the first \\(k\\) columns of `U`).\n        *   `s_k_vec = s_vec[:k]` (the first \\(k\\) singular values).\n        *   `Vh_k = Vh[:k, :]` (the first \\(k\\) rows of `Vh`).\n    *   The reconstructed matrix \\(\\hat{X}_{np}\\) is computed as \\(\\hat{X}_{np} = U_k \\cdot \\text{diag}(s_k\\_vec) \\cdot Vh_k\\).\n\n3.  **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:\n    *   The MSE between the original matrix `X_np` and the reconstructed matrix \\(\\hat{X}_{np}\\) is calculated as \\(\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{m \\cdot n} \\sum_{i,j} (X_{np, ij} - \\hat{X}_{np, ij})^2\\).

{"task_id": 39, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To perform a median split on a dataset for KD-Tree construction, we need to find the median element in a specified column `d`, then partition the dataset's row indices into three groups: the index of the median element (pivot), indices of elements strictly smaller than the median in column `d`, and indices of elements strictly larger. This process must be efficient, specifically O(n) time complexity, leveraging `numpy.argpartition`. The lists of indices for \"left\" (smaller) and \"right\" (larger) sets must be sorted.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:\n\n1.  **Handle Input**:\n    *   Get the number of samples, `n_samples`, from `data.shape[0]`.\n    *   We assume `n_samples >= 1`. If `n_samples` could be 0, specific error handling or return values would be needed, but this is not specified in the problem. The logic naturally handles `n_samples = 1` correctly.\n\n2.  **Determine Median Position**:\n    *   The problem defines the median position for `n` samples as `n // 2` (0-indexed). This index, `k_th_element_idx`, will be used with `np.argpartition`.\n\n3.  **Partitioning**:\n    *   Extract the `d`-th column from `data`.\n    *   Use `numpy.argpartition(column_values, k_th_element_idx)`. This function rearranges the elements (indirectly, by returning indices) such that the element at `k_th_element_idx` in the partitioned array is the one that would be at that position if the whole column were sorted. All elements before this position are less than or equal to it, and all elements after are greater than or equal to it. This operation has an average time complexity of O(n).\n    *   The `partitioned_indices` array contains the original row indices of the samples.\n\n4.  **Identify Pivot**:\n    *   The pivot's original row index is `partitioned_indices[k_th_element_idx]`.\n    *   The median value is `data[pivot_row_index, d]`.\n    *   Ensure the pivot index is returned as a Python `int`.\n\n5.  **Identify Left and Right Sets**:\n    *   To collect indices for the \"left\" (strictly smaller) and \"right\" (strictly larger) sets and ensure they are sorted in O(n) time, we use boolean masks:\n        *   Initialize `left_mask` and `right_mask` as boolean arrays of size `n_samples`, filled with `False`.\n    *   Iterate through the `partitioned_indices`:\n        *   For indices in `partitioned_indices[:k_th_element_idx]` (elements potentially smaller than or equal to the median): If `data[original_row_idx, d] < median_value`, set `left_mask[original_row_idx] = True`.\n        *   For indices in `partitioned_indices[k_th_element_idx+1:]` (elements potentially greater than or equal to the median): If `data[original_row_idx, d] > median_value`, set `right_mask[original_row_idx] = True`.\n    *   Elements with values equal to `median_value` (but are not the pivot itself) will not be included in either `left_mask` or `right_mask`, satisfying the \"strictly\" smaller/larger condition.\n\n6.  **Format Output**:\n    *   Convert the boolean masks to sorted lists of indices using `np.where(mask)[0].tolist()`. `np.where` returns indices where the mask is true; these indices are inherently sorted. `.tolist()` converts the NumPy array of indices into a Python list of `int`s. This step is O(n).\n    *   Return the 3-tuple: `(pivot_row_index, left_indices, right_indices)`.\n\nThis approach ensures all conditions are met: O(n) time complexity, use of `numpy.argpartition`, and sorted lists of indices for the left and right sets.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_split(data: np.ndarray, d: int) -> tuple[int, list[int], list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"Split *data* along column *d* by its median value.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    data : np.ndarray\n        2-D array of shape (n_samples, n_features).\n    d : int\n        Index of the column to use for the split.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple\n        (pivot, left, right) where\n        \u2022 pivot is the row index whose value in column *d* is the median;\n        \u2022 left  is a list of row indices with smaller values;\n        \u2022 right is a list of row indices with larger  values.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_samples = data.shape[0]\n\n    # Assuming n_samples >= 1.

{"task_id": 40, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To create a NumPy-based utility that breaks a one-dimensional signal into overlapping frames using `numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided`, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Input Validation**: Check the pre-conditions:\n    *   The input array `x` must be one-dimensional.\n    *   The `stride` must be a positive integer (i.e., `stride >= 1`).\n    *   The length of `x` must be greater than or equal to `frame_width`.\n    If any of these conditions are violated, an `AssertionError` should be raised. The problem statement also specifies that `frame_width` is a \"positive integer,\" implying `frame_width >= 1`. While not explicitly listed as an assertion to implement, this is a crucial property for the function's correctness. We will assume the caller adheres to this for `frame_width`, or rely on `as_strided` to potentially error out if `frame_width` is negative (leading to an invalid shape).\n\n2.  **Calculate Number of Frames (`n_frames`)**: The number of frames is given by the formula:\n    `n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1`\n    This formula correctly accounts for dropping any trailing samples from `x` that are insufficient to form a complete frame of length `frame_width`. Given the assertions (particularly `len(x) >= frame_width` and `stride >= 1`), `n_frames` will always be at least 1.\n\n3.  **Determine Strides for the View**: The `as_strided` function requires specifying the strides of the new array in bytes.\n    *   The original array `x` has an `itemsize` (bytes per element).\n    *   The output array has shape `(n_frames, frame_width)`.\n    *   To move from one frame to the next (i.e., to the next row in the output), we advance `stride` elements in the original array `x`. So, the stride for the first dimension (rows) is `stride * x.itemsize` bytes.\n    *   To move from one sample to the next within a frame (i.e., to the next column in the output), we advance `1` element in the original array `x`. So, the stride for the second dimension (columns) is `1 * x.itemsize` bytes.\n    *   Thus, the `strides` tuple for the new view will be `(stride * x.itemsize, x.itemsize)`.\n\n4.  **Create the View using `as_strided`**: Call `numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided` with the original array `x`, the calculated `shape=(n_frames, frame_width)`, and the calculated `strides`.\n\n5.  **Handle Writability**: The `writeable` boolean parameter controls the writability of the returned view.\n    *   If `writeable=False`, the view must be read-only. This is achieved by passing `writeable=False` to `as_strided`.\n    *   If `writeable=True`, the view should inherit the writability of the original array `x`.

{"task_id": 56, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the SoftPlus activation function and its derivative, we need to consider numerical stability, input types, and output formatting.\n\n**SoftPlus Function**:\nSoftPlus$(x) = \\log(1+e^{x})$\nFor large positive $x$, $e^x$ can overflow. In this case, SoftPlus$(x) \\approx \\log(e^x) = x$.\nFor large negative $x$, $e^x \\to 0$. SoftPlus$(x) \\approx \\log(1) = 0$.\nA numerically stable formulation is `max(0, x) + log(1 + exp(-abs(x)))`.\nLet's verify this:\n1.  If $x > 0$: $x + \\log(1 + e^{-x})$. This is equivalent to $x + \\log(e^{-x}(e^x+1)) = x + (-x + \\log(e^x+1)) = \\log(1+e^x)$. This form is stable because $e^{-x}$ is small for large positive $x$.\n2.  If $x \\le 0$: $0 + \\log(1 + e^{-(-x)}) = \\log(1 + e^{x})$. This is the original form, which is stable for $x \\le 0$ because $e^x$ does not overflow.\nThis combined expression can be implemented using NumPy functions like `np.maximum`, `np.abs`, `np.exp`, and `np.log1p` (which computes $\\log(1+y)$ accurately for small $y$).\n\n**Derivative (Sigmoid Function)**:\n$\\sigma(x) = \\dfrac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$\nThis standard form is generally robust in NumPy:\n1.  If $x$ is large positive, $e^{-x} \\to 0$, so $\\sigma(x) \\to 1/(1+0) = 1$.\n2.  If $x$ is large negative (e.g., $x = -710$), then $-x$ is large positive. $e^{-x}$ (i.e. $e^{710}$) overflows to `inf`. $\\sigma(x) \\to 1/(1+\\text{inf}) = 0$.\nNumPy's `np.exp` handles overflow by returning `inf` and underflow by returning `0.0`. These values then propagate correctly through the division. We can suppress potential `RuntimeWarning` for overflow/underflow in `exp` as the final results are mathematically correct.\n\n**Implementation Details**:\n1.  **Input Handling**: The function will accept scalars (int/float), Python lists, or NumPy arrays. All inputs will be converted to a `np.float64` NumPy array for consistent numerical processing. The original input type (scalar or not) will be tracked to format the output correctly.\n2.  **Calculation**: Based on the `deriv` flag, either the SoftPlus or Sigmoid formula will be applied element-wise using NumPy's vectorized operations.\n3.  **Numerical Stability**: The chosen formulas are designed for stability. `np.log1p` is crucial for SoftPlus.\n4.  **Rounding**: Results will be rounded to 4 decimal places using `np.round()`.\n5.  **Output Format**: If the input was a scalar, a single float is returned. Otherwise (list or NumPy array input), a Python list of floats is returned. Empty list inputs will result in an empty list output.\n6.  **Error Handling**: Basic `TypeError` will be raised for invalid input types or non-numeric content in lists/arrays.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef softplus(x, deriv: bool = False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the SoftPlus activation function or its derivative (Sigmoid).\n\n    The SoftPlus function is defined as SoftPlus(x) = log(1 + exp(x)).\n    Its derivative is the logistic (sigmoid) function sigma(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)).\n\n    This implementation uses numerically stable formulations.\n\n    Args:\n        x: A scalar (int or float), Python list of numbers, or NumPy array of real values.\n        deriv: A boolean flag.\n               If False (default), computes SoftPlus(x) element-wise.\n               If True, computes the derivative (Sigmoid function) element-wise.\n\n    Returns:\n        If x is a scalar: The computed value as a float, rounded to 4 decimal places.\n        If x is a list or NumPy array: A Python list of floats,\n                                     where each float is the computed value\n                                     rounded to 4 decimal places.\n                                     Returns an empty list if the input is an empty list/array.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input x is not a scalar, list, or NumPy array, or if\n                   list/array elements are not convertible to real numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    is_scalar_input = False\n    if isinstance(x, (int, float)):\n        is_scalar_input = True\n        # Convert scalar to a 1-element array for uniform NumPy processing\n        x_np = np.array([x], dtype=np.float64)\n    elif isinstance(x, list):\n        try:\n            # Convert list to NumPy array; np.array handles empty list correctly\n            # and attempts to convert elements.\n            x_np = np.array(x, dtype=np.float64)\n        except ValueError as e:\n            # This catches errors if list elements cannot be converted to float\n            # (e.g., list contains strings like 'a').\n            raise TypeError(\"Input list elements must be convertible to real numbers.\") from e\n    elif isinstance(x, np.ndarray):\n        # Ensure NumPy array is of a numeric type.\n        if not np.issubdtype(x.dtype, np.number):\n            # This catches arrays of non-numeric types like strings or objects.\n            raise TypeError(\"Input NumPy array must have a numeric dtype.\")\n        x_np = x.astype(np.float64) # Convert to float64 for consistent precision\n    else:\n        raise TypeError(\"Input x must be a scalar (int/float), Python list, or NumPy array.\")\n\n    # Perform calculations\n    # Suppress RuntimeWarnings for overflow/underflow in np.exp,\n    # as the formulas are designed to handle inf/0.0 results correctly.\n    with np.errstate(over='ignore', under='ignore'):\n        if deriv:\n            # Derivative: Sigmoid function sigma(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))\n            # This form is generally numerically stable in NumPy.\n            result_np = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-x_np))\n        else:\n            # SoftPlus function: SoftPlus(x) = log(1 + exp(x))\n            # Numerically stable formulation: max(0, x) + log(1 + exp(-abs(x)))\n            # For x > 0:  x + log1p(exp(-x))\n            # For x <= 0: log1p(exp(x))\n            # This form avoids overflow for large positive x (where exp(x) would overflow)\n            # and maintains precision for all x.\n            # Note: -np.abs(x_np) ensures the argument to exp is non-positive (<=0),\n            # preventing overflow in np.exp.

{"task_id": 70, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "The FP-Growth algorithm discovers frequent item-sets in a transactional database. It generally consists of three main steps:\n\n1.  **First Pass - Count Item Frequencies and Filter:**\n    *   Scan the transactions once to count the support (occurrence frequency) of each individual item.\n    *   Discard items whose support is less than the specified `min_support` threshold.\n    *   The remaining frequent items are sorted, typically in descending order of their support. If supports are equal, items are sorted lexicographically. This sorted list (often called the \"header order\") is crucial for the next steps.\n\n2.  **Second Pass - Build the FP-Tree:**\n    *   Create the root of the FP-Tree (a prefix tree).\n    *   For each transaction:\n        *   Remove infrequent items.\n        *   Sort the remaining frequent items according to the header order established in step 1.\n        *   Insert this sorted transaction into the FP-Tree. Each node in the tree stores an item name, a support count, a parent pointer, and pointers to children nodes.\n        *   Nodes representing the same item are linked together using a \"node link\" structure, typically managed by a header table. This allows efficient traversal of all occurrences of an item in the tree.\n\n3.  **Recursive Mining of Conditional FP-Trees:**\n    *   The FP-Growth algorithm mines the FP-Tree recursively to find frequent item-sets.\n    *   It starts by considering each frequent item from the header table (processed in reverse order of the header order, i.e., from least frequent to most frequent).\n    *   For each such item (let's call it `item_suffix`):\n        *   The item-sets ending with `item_suffix` are generated. The current `item_suffix` combined with the `prefix` (from previous recursion levels) forms a frequent item-set.\n        *   A **conditional pattern base** for `item_suffix` is constructed. This consists of all prefix paths in the FP-Tree that co-occur with `item_suffix`. Each path in this base has an associated count (the support of `item_suffix` in that path).\n        *   A **conditional FP-Tree** is built from this conditional pattern base. This is like building a new FP-Tree, but using the paths from the conditional pattern base as \"transactions\" and their associated counts. Infrequent items in this conditional context are again pruned.\n        *   If the conditional FP-Tree is not empty, the algorithm recursively calls itself to mine this new tree, with `item_suffix` added to the current `prefix`.\n    *   This process continues until no more conditional FP-Trees can be built.\n\nThe final list of all discovered frequent item-sets is then sorted according to the specified deterministic criteria: first by increasing item-set length, and then lexicographically for item-sets of the same length. Items within each item-set are also sorted lexicographically.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Helper class for FP-Tree nodes\nclass FPTreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, item_name, count, parent_node):\n        self.item_name = item_name\n        self.count = count\n        self.parent = parent_node\n        self.children = {}  # item_name -> FPTreeNode\n        self.node_link = None # Link to next node with same item_name\n\n    def increment_count(self, count_val=1):\n        self.count += count_val\n\n# Recursive mining function\n# current_header_table: maps item -> [count, node_link_head] for the current (conditional) tree\n# current_header_order: list of items in the current (conditional) tree, sorted by freq (desc), then name (asc)\n# min_support: minimum support threshold\n# prefix: the current prefix itemset being extended (items are sorted lexicographically)\n# frequent_itemsets_result: the list to accumulate all found frequent itemsets\ndef _mine_fp_tree_recursive(current_header_table: dict, \n                            current_header_order: list[str], \n                            min_support: int, \n                            prefix: list[str], \n                            frequent_itemsets_result: list[list[str]]):\n    \n    # Iterate through items in current_header_order in reverse order.\n    # This means processing from the least frequent item to the most frequent item\n    # in the current conditional FP-tree's header table.\n    for item_suffix in reversed(current_header_order):\n        # Form the new frequent itemset by adding item_suffix to the current prefix.\n        # This new itemset's support is item_suffix's count in current_header_table.\n        # All items in current_header_table (and thus current_header_order) already meet min_support\n        # in the context of the current conditional tree.\n        # Sort items within the itemset lexicographically for deterministic output.\n        new_frequent_set = sorted(prefix + [item_suffix])\n        frequent_itemsets_result.append(new_frequent_set)\n        \n        # Construct the conditional pattern base for item_suffix.\n        # These are the prefix paths in the current FP-tree that co-occur with item_suffix.\n        conditional_pattern_base = []\n        # Start from the head of the node-link chain for item_suffix.\n        path_node = current_header_table[item_suffix][1] \n        \n        while path_node is not None:\n            prefix_path_items = []\n            # Traverse upwards from path_node's parent to the root to get the prefix path.\n            current_path_trace_node = path_node.parent\n            while current_path_trace_node.item_name is not None: # Stop when root is reached (root.item_name is None)\n                prefix_path_items.append(current_path_trace_node.item_name)\n                current_path_trace_node = current_path_trace_node.parent\n            \n            if prefix_path_items: # Only if the prefix path is not empty\n                # The path was collected upwards (from node to root), so reverse it to get top-down order.\n                # The count associated with this path is the count of path_node (the item_suffix node).\n                conditional_pattern_base.append((list(reversed(prefix_path_items)), path_node.count))\n            \n            path_node = path_node.node_link # Move to the next node in item_suffix's chain.\n\n        if not conditional_pattern_base: # No patterns, so no conditional tree to build for this item_suffix.\n            continue\n\n        # --- Construct Conditional FP-Tree for item_suffix ---\n        \n        # 1.

This allows for efficient vectorized operations, especially for distance calculations.\n\n3.  **Prediction Loop**:\n    *   Iterate through each sample (`test_sample_features`) in `X_test_np`. For each `test_sample_features`:\n        *   **Distance Calculation (Rule 1)**: Compute the squared Euclidean distance from `test_sample_features` to every sample in `X_train_np`. The squared Euclidean distance between two vectors `a` and `b` is `sum((a_i - b_i)^2)`. Using squared distances is acceptable because the square root function is monotonic and won't change the ordering of nearest neighbors. This can be done efficiently using NumPy: `distances_sq = np.sum((X_train_np - test_sample_features)**2, axis=1)`.\n        *   **Identify k-Nearest Neighbors**: Find the indices of the `k` training samples that have the smallest distances to `test_sample_features`. `np.argsort(distances_sq)` will give the indices that would sort the distances array, so the first `k` indices correspond to the `k` nearest neighbors: `nearest_neighbor_indices = np.argsort(distances_sq)[:k]`.\n        *   **Get Labels of Neighbors**: Retrieve the class labels of these `k` neighbors from `y_train_np` using `k_nearest_labels = y_train_np[nearest_neighbor_indices]`.\n        *   **Majority Vote and Tie-Breaking (Rule 2)**:\n            *   Count the occurrences of each class label among `k_nearest_labels`. `np.unique(k_nearest_labels, return_counts=True)` is useful here, as it returns sorted unique labels and their corresponding counts.\n            *   Find the maximum count (`max_count`).\n            *   Identify all class labels that have this `max_count`. These are the candidates for the predicted class.\n            *   If there's a tie (multiple classes have `max_count`), select the **smallest** class label among them.

We'll convert them to NumPy arrays using `np.asarray()` for efficient numerical operations. This function avoids unnecessary data copying if the inputs are already NumPy arrays.\n\n2.  **Epsilon (\u03b5) for Numerical Stability**: To prevent `log(0)` which is undefined, a small positive value \u03b5 (epsilon) is added to the predicted probabilities `\u0177_{ij}`. We'll use machine epsilon, which is the smallest number such that `1.0 + epsilon != 1.0`. NumPy provides this via `np.finfo(dtype).eps`. The `dtype` will be inferred from `y_pred_np` to match its precision (e.g., `float32` or `float64`).\n\n3.  **Logarithm Calculation**: After adding epsilon, we compute the natural logarithm (`np.log()`) of each element `(\u0177_{ij} + \u03b5)`.\n\n4.  **Element-wise Multiplication**: The true labels `y_{ij}` are multiplied element-wise with the corresponding `log(\u0177_{ij} + \u03b5)`. Since `y` is one-hot encoded (contains 0s and a single 1 per sample/row), this multiplication effectively selects only the log-probability of the true class for each sample. For example, if `y_i = [0, 1, 0]`, then only the term related to the second class contributes to the sum for sample `i`.\n\n5.  **Summation**: The resulting terms `y_{ij}\u00b7log(\u0177_{ij}+\u03b5)` are summed up across all classes (`j`) and all samples (`i`). `np.sum()` applied to the resulting 2D array will achieve this.\n\n6.  **Negation**: The total sum is negated as per the formula `L = -\u2211...`.\n\n7.  **Rounding**: The final loss `L` is rounded to four decimal places using Python's built-in `round()` function.\n\nThe implementation assumes valid inputs as per the problem description (correct shapes, `y` is one-hot, `y_pred` contains valid probabilities).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef cross_entropy_loss(y: list | 'np.ndarray', y_pred: list | 'np.ndarray') -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute the unnormalised categorical cross-entropy loss.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    y : list | np.ndarray\n        One-hot encoded true labels of shape (n_samples, n_classes).\n    y_pred : list | np.ndarray\n        Predicted probabilities of the same shape produced by a model.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    float\n        Total cross-entropy loss for the batch, rounded to 4 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert inputs to NumPy arrays.\n    # np.asarray is used as it avoids copying if inputs are already ndarrays\n    # of a compatible type.\n    y_true_np = np.asarray(y)\n    y_pred_np = np.asarray(y_pred)\n\n    # Determine epsilon for numerical stability.\n    # Based on the data type of y_pred_np to handle float32 or float64 appropriately.\n    # It's assumed y_pred_np will have a floating-point dtype as it represents probabilities\n    # from a softmax layer.\n    if np.issubdtype(y_pred_np.dtype, np.floating):\n        epsilon = np.finfo(y_pred_np.dtype).eps\n    else:\n        # Fallback for non-float types, though inputs are assumed valid (probabilities).\n        # This branch would typically not be reached with valid inputs.\n        # Defaulting to standard float64 epsilon.\n        epsilon = np.finfo(float).eps\n    \n    # The formula for categorical cross-entropy loss is:\n    # L = -\u2211_{i=1}^{n_samples} \u2211_{j=1}^{n_classes} y_{ij} * log(\u0177_{ij} + \u03b5)\n\n    # Step 1: Add epsilon to predicted probabilities: \u0177_{ij} + \u03b5\n    # This prevents log(0) errors.\n    y_pred_plus_eps = y_pred_np + epsilon\n    \n    # Step 2: Take the natural logarithm: log(\u0177_{ij} + \u03b5)\n    log_y_pred = np.log(y_pred_plus_eps)\n    \n    # Step 3: Multiply by true labels: y_{ij} * log(\u0177_{ij} + \u03b5)\n    # Since y_true_np is one-hot, only the term corresponding to the true class\n    # (where y_ij = 1) will be non-zero for each sample.\n    # This is an element-wise product.\n    terms = y_true_np * log_y_pred\n    \n    # Step 4: Sum all terms: \u2211_{i} \u2211_{j} y_{ij} * log(\u0177_{ij} + \u03b5)\n    # np.sum() without a specified axis sums all elements in the array.\n    sum_of_terms = np.sum(terms)\n    \n    # Step 5: Negate the sum to get the final loss: L\n    loss = -sum_of_terms\n    \n    # Round the loss to four decimal places.\n    # Python's round() function is used (rounds .5 to nearest even digit).\n    rounded_loss = round(loss, 4)\n    \n    return rounded_loss\n\n```"}

For a sequence of length `M`, there are `M - N + 1` such N-grams.\n    *   For each N-gram extracted from the target sequence:\n        *   Let the N-gram be `(w_1, w_2, ..., w_N)`.\n        *   The term `w_i` in the formula `P(w_i|context)` corresponds to `w_N`.\n        *   The `context` corresponds to `(w_1, ..., w_{N-1})`.\n        *   Retrieve `count_context_word = n_gram_counts.get((w_1, ..., w_N), 0)`.\n        *   Retrieve `count_context`:\n            *   If N=1, `context_tuple = ()`, `count_context = n_minus_1_gram_counts.get((), 0)`.\n            *   If N>1, `context_tuple = (w_1, ..., w_{N-1})`, `count_context = n_minus_1_gram_counts.get(context_tuple, 0)`.\n        *   Apply the additive smoothing formula:\n            `prob = (count_context_word + K) / (count_context + K * V)`\n        *   Add `math.log(prob)` to `total_log_prob`.\n            (Note: `K` is assumed to be `> 0` for smoothing, ensuring `prob > 0` and `math.log(prob)` is well-defined.)\n\n5.  **Return Value**:\n    *   Return `total_log_prob` rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\nThis approach uses `collections.Counter` for frequency counting. The vocabulary `V` correctly includes `<UNK>`. OOV words in the target sequence are mapped to `<UNK>`, and their counts (if `<UNK>` itself is the target word) will be 0 from `n_gram_counts` (as `<UNK>` is not part of `corpus_vocab` during training counts), relying on the `+K` smoothing term for their probability.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter, defaultdict # defaultdict is allowed by problem statement\n\ndef additive_ngram_log_prob(corpus: list[str], sequence: str, N: int, K: float = 1.0) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute the additive-smoothed log-probability of *sequence* given a corpus.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    corpus : list[str]\n        Training sentences (white-space separated).\n    sequence : str\n        Sentence whose probability must be evaluated.\n    N : int\n        Order of the N-gram model.\n    K : float, default = 1.0\n        Smoothing constant (Laplace when 1.0).\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    float\n        Natural logarithm of the sentence probability rounded to 4 decimals.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Corpus Processing & Vocabulary Creation\n    all_corpus_words = []\n    tokenized_corpus_sentences = []\n    for s in corpus:\n        words = s.split()\n        if not words:  # Skip empty sentences if any in corpus\n            continue\n        tokenized_corpus_sentences.append(words)\n        all_corpus_words.extend(words)\n\n    corpus_vocab = set(all_corpus_words)\n    V = len(corpus_vocab) + 1  # Add 1 for the <UNK> token\n\n    # Step 2: N-gram Frequency Tables\n    # n_gram_counts stores counts of N-grams (context + word_to_predict)\n    # n_minus_1_gram_counts stores counts of (N-1)-grams (contexts)\n    \n    n_gram_counts = Counter()\n    n_minus_1_gram_counts = Counter()\n\n    if N == 1:\n        # For N=1, N-grams are unigrams.

{"task_id": 108, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the regularized Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm, we aim to find two low-rank matrices, W (N\u00d7K) and H (K\u00d7M), that minimize the objective function:\n`L(W, H) = \u2016X \u2212 WH\u2016\u00b2_F + \u03b1(\u2016W\u2016\u00b2_F + \u2016H\u2016\u00b2_F)`\nwhere X is the input N\u00d7M matrix, K is the number of latent factors, and \u03b1 is the L2 regularization weight. The Frobenius norm squared `\u2016A\u2016\u00b2_F` is the sum of squares of the elements of A.\n\nThe ALS algorithm iteratively optimizes W and H:\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Initialize W and H with random values. For deterministic results required by the problem, `np.random.seed(0)` is used before generating random numbers for W and H. `W` is of shape (N, K) and `H` is of shape (K, M).\n\n2.  **Alternating Updates**:\n    The algorithm iterates, updating H while keeping W fixed, and then updating W while keeping H fixed.\n\n    *   **Update H (fixing W)**:\n        We need to minimize `L(H) = \u2016X \u2212 WH\u2016\u00b2_F + \u03b1\u2016H\u2016\u00b2_F` with respect to H (the term `\u03b1\u2016W\u2016\u00b2_F` is constant in this step).\n        This is a regularized least squares problem. The solution for H is given by:\n        `H = (W^T W + \u03b1I_K)^(-1) W^T X`\n        where `I_K` is the K\u00d7K identity matrix. Numerically, this is solved as `A_H H = B_H` where `A_H = W^T W + \u03b1I_K` and `B_H = W^T X`.\n\n    *   **Update W (fixing H)**:\n        We need to minimize `L(W) = \u2016X \u2212 WH\u2016\u00b2_F + \u03b1\u2016W\u2016\u00b2_F` with respect to W (the term `\u03b1\u2016H\u2016\u00b2_F` is constant).\n        This can be rewritten by considering the transpose: `\u2016X^T \u2212 H^T W^T\u2016\u00b2_F + \u03b1\u2016W^T\u2016\u00b2_F`.\n        The solution for `W^T` is analogous to the H update:\n        `W^T = (H H^T + \u03b1I_K)^(-1) H X^T`\n        So, `W = ( (H H^T + \u03b1I_K)^(-1) H X^T )^T`.\n        Numerically, this is solved as `A_W W^T = B_W` where `A_W = H H^T + \u03b1I_K` and `B_W = H X^T`.

That is, a point `x` is chosen with probability `D(x)^2 / sum(D(y)^2 for all y in X)`.\n        *   An efficient way to implement this is to maintain `min_sq_distances_to_any_chosen_centroid` for each point. When a new centroid `c_new` is chosen, update this array for each point `x` by taking `min(current_min_sq_dist(x), dist_sq(x, c_new))`.\n        *   If the sum of all `D(x)^2` values becomes zero (e.g., if `K` is larger than the number of unique points, or points are perfectly co-located with already chosen centroids), subsequent centroids are chosen uniformly at random from `X`.\n\n3.  **Lloyd's Algorithm (Iterative Refinement)**:\n    *   This part consists of repeating two steps (\"assign\u2013update\") until convergence or `max_iter` is reached:\n        *   **Assignment Step**: Assign each data point in `X` to the cluster whose current centroid is closest (using Euclidean distance).

{"task_id": 115, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the `logistic_loss_and_gradient` function, we will follow the mathematical definitions provided for the binary cross-entropy loss and its gradient in the context of logistic regression.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1.  **Prepare Inputs**: Ensure the weight vector `w` and target vector `y` are column vectors to maintain consistent matrix operations and to meet the gradient output format requirement (`list[list[float]]`). The number of samples `m` is derived from the feature matrix `X`.\n2.  **Linear Combination**: Calculate `z = X \u00b7 w`. This is the linear input to the sigmoid function.\n3.  **Sigmoid Activation**: Compute the predicted probabilities `p = \u03c3(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(\u2013z))`. Each element `p_i` is the predicted probability that sample `i` belongs to the positive class.\n4.  **Numerical Stability**: To prevent `log(0)` errors, the predicted probabilities `p` are clipped. If `p_i` is 0, it's replaced by a small epsilon (`1e-20`). If `p_i` is 1, it's replaced by `1 - epsilon`. This ensures that arguments to `np.log` are always positive and non-zero. `np.clip(p, epsilon, 1 - epsilon)` handles this.\n5.  **Loss Calculation**: Compute the average binary cross-entropy loss:\n    `J(w) = \u2013 1/m \u00b7 \u03a3 [ y\u1d62 \u00b7 ln(p\u1d62_clipped) + (1 \u2013 y\u1d62) \u00b7 ln(1 \u2013 p\u1d62_clipped) ]`.\n    Here, `p_clipped` refers to the numerically stabilized probabilities.\n6.  **Gradient Calculation**: Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights `w`:\n    `\u2207J(w) = 1/m \u00b7 X\u1d40 (p \u2013 y)`. Note that the original (unclipped) probabilities `p` are used in this formula.\n7.  **Formatting Output**:\n    *   Round the calculated loss to 4 decimal places.

If `X_train` is empty (0 samples) or has 0 features, return default predictions for `X_test` (e.g., all 1s, or majority class from `y_train` if applicable).\n    *   Initialize sample weights `w_i` uniformly for all `m` training samples: `w_i = 1/m`.\n    *   Create an empty list to store the trained decision stumps (classifiers).\n\n2.  **Decision Stump (Weak Learner)**:\n    *   We'll define a `DecisionStump` class.

Let this be `Z_c`.\n        *   The scatter matrix for class `c`, `S_c = Z_c^T Z_c`, is calculated. This is equivalent to `\u03a3_{x\u2208c} (x\u2212\u03bc_c)(x\u2212\u03bc_c)^T` where `x` and `\u03bc_c` are treated as column vectors for the outer product (or row vectors `x-\u03bc_c` for `(x-\u03bc_c)^T (x-\u03bc_c)` if `x-\u03bc_c` is a row vector, and the sum is `Z_c^T Z_c` where `Z_c`'s rows are `x-\u03bc_c`).\n    *   `S_W` is the sum of all `S_c` over all classes. `S_W` will be a `d x d` matrix, where `d` is the number of features.\n\n3.  **Compute Between-Class Scatter Matrix (S_B)**:\n    *   Compute the global mean vector `\u03bc` of all samples in `X`.\n    *   Iterate through each unique class label. For each class `c`:\n        *   Use the pre-computed class mean `\u03bc_c` and the number of samples `N_c` in that class.\n        *   Calculate the term `N_c * (\u03bc_c\u2212\u03bc)(\u03bc_c\u2212\u03bc)^T`. Again, `(\u03bc_c\u2212\u03bc)` is treated as a column vector for the outer product.\n    *   `S_B` is the sum of these terms over all classes. `S_B` will also be a `d x d` matrix.\n\n4.  **Form Matrix A**:\n    *   Compute `A = pinv(S_W) @ S_B`, where `pinv(S_W)` is the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of `S_W`. This is used to handle cases where `S_W` might be singular (e.g., if the number of samples is small or features are collinear).\n\n5.  **Eigen-decomposition of A**:\n    *   Perform eigen-decomposition on `A`. The problem states that `A` is symmetric and to use `numpy.linalg.eigh`. This function returns eigenvalues in ascending order and corresponding eigenvectors as columns in a matrix.\n    *   Sort the eigen-pairs (eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector) in descending order based on the eigenvalues.\n\n6.  **Select and Adjust Eigenvectors (Projection Matrix W)**:\n    *   Select the top `n_components` eigenvectors (columns from the sorted eigenvector matrix). These form the columns of the projection matrix `W` (shape `d x n_components`).\n    *   **Deterministic Sign Fix**: For each selected eigenvector in `W`:\n        *   Find its first non-zero element.\n        *   If this element is negative, flip the sign of the entire eigenvector (multiply it by -1). This ensures deterministic output across different environments.\n\n7.  **Project Data**:\n    *   Project the original data `X` onto the chosen discriminant directions: `X_projected = X @ W`. The resulting projected data will have shape `m x n_components`.\n    *   Round every element in `X_projected` to four decimal places.\n\n8.  **Return Projected Data**:\n    *   Convert the rounded projected data (NumPy array) to a Python `list of lists` using `ndarray.tolist()` and return it.\n\nThis process finds a lower-dimensional subspace where classes are well-separated.

{"task_id": 140, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "The problem asks us to find the minimum time for an agent to travel from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (n-1,n-1) of a grid maze. The maze contains free cells ('.'), walls ('#'), and initial fire sources ('F'). Both the agent and fire spread to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) in one minute. A crucial rule is that fire spreads first, then the agent moves. The agent can only enter a cell if it's not on fire at the moment of arrival.\n\nThis problem can be solved using two Breadth-First Searches (BFS):\n1.  **Fire BFS**: To determine the time it takes for fire to reach each cell. Let `fire_time[r][c]` be this time for cell `(r,c)`. Initialize `fire_time` with infinity for all cells. For cells initially marked 'F', `fire_time[r][c] = 0`. Perform a BFS starting from all 'F' cells simultaneously. When fire spreads from a cell `(r,c)` (reached at time `t`) to an adjacent non-wall cell `(nr,nc)`, `fire_time[nr][nc]` becomes `t + 1`.\n\n2.  **Agent BFS**: To find the shortest path for the agent. The state in this BFS will be `((r, c), time)`, representing the agent at cell `(r,c)` at a given `time`. We want to minimize this `time`.\n    - The agent starts at `(0,0)` at `time = 0`.\n    - When the agent moves from `(r,c)` at `agent_t` to an adjacent cell `(nr,nc)`, they arrive at `(nr,nc)` at `agent_arrival_t = agent_t + 1`.\n    - **Safety Condition**: For this move to be valid, `(nr,nc)` must not be on fire when the agent arrives. This means `agent_arrival_t` must be strictly less than `fire_time[nr][nc]`. If `agent_arrival_t >= fire_time[nr][nc]`, the cell is already burning or catches fire at the exact moment the agent arrives, making it unsafe.\n    - We use another 2D array, `min_agent_arrival_time[r][c]`, to store the minimum time the agent can reach `(r,c)` safely. This also helps avoid cycles and redundant computations in the BFS.\n\n**Initial Conditions and Edge Cases**:\n-   If the grid is empty (`n=0`), it's an invalid scenario; return -1.\n-   If the start `(0,0)` or goal `(n-1,n-1)` is a wall ('#'), it's impossible; return -1.\n-   **Important Note 1**: If the start or goal cell is initially on fire ('F'), the task is impossible; return -1. This check should be done early.\n-   **Important Note 2**: If the maze is 1x1 and the cell is '.', the agent is already at the goal; time = 0. (If it's 'F' or '#', it's covered by the above checks).\n\n**Algorithm Steps**:\n1.  Handle initial checks: grid size, walls at start/goal, 'F' at start/goal, 1x1 maze.\n2.  Perform Fire BFS:\n    - Initialize `fire_time` array with `math.inf`.\n    - Create a queue for fire BFS and add all initial 'F' cells with `fire_time = 0`.\n    - Run BFS to populate `fire_time` for all reachable cells.\n3.  Perform Agent BFS:\n    - Initialize `min_agent_arrival_time` array with `math.inf`.\n    - Create a queue for agent BFS. Add `((0,0), 0)` if `(0,0)` is initially safe (which it will be if it passed the 'F' check, as fire takes at least 1 minute to spread to an adjacent '.' cell). Set `min_agent_arrival_time[0][0] = 0`.\n    - While the agent queue is not empty:\n        - Dequeue `((r,c), agent_t)`.\n        - For each valid neighbor `(nr,nc)` (within bounds, not a wall):\n            - `agent_arrival_at_neighbor_t = agent_t + 1`.\n            - If `agent_arrival_at_neighbor_t < fire_time[nr][nc]` (safe to move) AND `agent_arrival_at_neighbor_t < min_agent_arrival_time[nr][nc]` (shorter path found):\n                - Update `min_agent_arrival_time[nr][nc] = agent_arrival_at_neighbor_t`.\n                - If `(nr,nc)` is the goal `(n-1,n-1)`, return `agent_arrival_at_neighbor_t`.\n                - Enqueue `((nr,nc), agent_arrival_at_neighbor_t)`.\n4.  If the agent queue becomes empty and the goal hasn't been reached, it's impossible; return -1.\n\nThis approach ensures finding the minimum time because BFS explores paths layer by layer (shortest time first).\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nimport math\n\ndef escape_fire_maze(grid: list[str]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Escape from a maze with spreading fire.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    grid : list[str]\n        Square maze represented as a list of strings.

{"task_id": 160, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement Lasso regression using coordinate descent, we will follow the specified algorithm steps. The core idea is to iteratively optimize each weight (coordinate) while keeping others fixed, applying a soft-thresholding operation to incorporate the L1 penalty.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Preprocessing and Initialization:**\n    *   The input feature matrix `X` (shape `m x n`) and target vector `y` (length `m`) are given.\n    *   If `fit_intercept` is `True`, an all-ones column is prepended to `X` to represent the intercept term. Otherwise, an all-zeros column is prepended. This augmented matrix `X_aug` will have shape `m x (n+1)`. The first column of `X_aug` always corresponds to the intercept.\n    *   The augmented weight vector `w_aug` (length `n+1`) is initialized to all zeros. `w_aug[0]` is the intercept, and `w_aug[1:]` are the feature weights. The L1 penalty does not apply to the intercept.\n\n2.  **Iterative Optimization (Outer Loop):**\n    *   The process is repeated for `max_iters` iterations.\n    *   **Intercept Update:** If `fit_intercept` is `True`, the intercept `w_aug[0]` is recomputed at the start of each outer iteration. It's set to the mean of the current residuals, where residuals are calculated as `y - (X_features @ w_features)`. `X_features` refers to the original feature columns in `X_aug` (i.e., `X_aug[:, 1:]`), and `w_features` are the corresponding weights (`w_aug[1:]`). If `fit_intercept` is `False`, `w_aug[0]` remains zero.\n\n3.  **Coordinate Loop (Inner Loop):**\n    *   For each feature weight `w_j` (from `j=1` to `n` in `w_aug`, corresponding to original features):\n        *   **Temporarily Zero Out Weight:** The current weight `w_aug[j]` is set to 0.\n        *   **Compute Partial Residual:** The partial residual `r_j` is calculated as `r_j = y - X_aug @ w_aug`. Since `w_aug[j]` is currently 0, `X_aug @ w_aug` effectively computes $Xw_{\\neg j}$ (predictions using all features except $j$, plus the intercept term).\n        *   **Compute $\\rho_j$:** Calculate $\\rho_j = \\langle x_j, r_j \\rangle = X_{\\text{aug},j}^\\top r_j$, where $X_{\\text{aug},j}$ is the $j$-th column of `X_aug`.\n        *   **Soft-Thresholding:** The threshold $\\tau = \\lambda m$ is computed, where $\\lambda$ is `lambda_param` and $m$ is the number of samples. The soft-thresholding operator $S(a, \\tau) = \\text{sign}(a) \\cdot \\max(|a|-\\tau, 0)$ is applied to $\\rho_j$.\n        *   **Update Weight:** The weight $w_j$ is updated as $w_aug[j] \\leftarrow S(\\rho_j, \\tau) / \\sum_i x_{ij}^2$. If $\\sum_i x_{ij}^2$ (sum of squares of elements in column $X_{\\text{aug},j}$) is zero, $w_aug[j]$ is set to 0.\n\n4.  **Finalization:**\n    *   After `max_iters`, the intercept `b` is `w_aug[0]` and the feature weights `w` are `w_aug[1:]`.\n    *   All returned values (bias and elements of weights list) are rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\nThis process iteratively refines the weights to minimize the Lasso objective function. The L1 penalty encourages sparsity, potentially setting some feature weights to zero.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef fit_lasso(X: np.ndarray,\n              y: np.ndarray,\n              lambda_param: float = 1.0,\n              max_iters: int = 100,\n              fit_intercept: bool = True) -> tuple[list[float], float]:\n    \"\"\"Fit Lasso (L1-regularised) linear regression using coordinate descent.\n\n    The function should learn a weight vector and optional intercept that\n    minimise squared loss + \u03bb\u2006\u00b7\u2006L1-norm.  **Do not** use scikit-learn; rely\n    solely on NumPy and the algorithm described in the task description.\n\n    Args:\n        X:   2-D array of shape (m, n) \u2013 feature matrix.\n        y:   1-D array of length m \u2013 target values.\n        lambda_param: Regularisation strength \u03bb (non-negative).\n        max_iters: Number of full passes over the coordinates.\n        fit_intercept: Whether to fit an intercept term.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple (weights, bias) where `weights` is a list of length n and `bias`\n        is a float.

{"task_id": 176, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement AdaBoost with decision stumps from scratch, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Decision Stump Implementation**:\n    *   We'll create a `DecisionStump` class to store its parameters: `feature_index`, `threshold`, and `polarity`.\n    *   This class will also have a `predict` method that takes a feature matrix `X` and returns predictions in the {-1, 1} format.\n    *   Polarity definition:\n        *   `polarity = 1`: Predict +1 if `feature_value < threshold`, else -1.\n        *   `polarity = -1`: Predict +1 if `feature_value >= threshold`, else -1.\n\n2.  **Finding the Best Stump (`_find_best_stump` function)**:\n    *   This helper function will search for the decision stump that minimizes the weighted classification error on the training data.\n    *   It iterates through:\n        *   All features (`feature_index`).\n        *   All unique values in the current feature column as potential `thresholds`.\n        *   Both `polarities` (1 and -1).\n    *   The weighted error is calculated as `error = \u03a3 w_i * [y_i \u2260 h(x_i)]`, where `w_i` are sample weights, and `y_i, h(x_i)` are in {-1, 1}.\n    *   Tie-breaking rules are applied: smallest `feature_index`, then smallest `threshold`, then `polarity = 1` before `polarity = -1`.\n\n3.  **AdaBoost Algorithm (`adaboost_predict` function)**:\n    *   **Initialization**:\n        *   Convert input `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test` (Python lists) to NumPy arrays.\n        *   Handle edge cases: empty training/test sets, or training data with zero features.\n        *   Transform `y_train` labels from {0, 1} to {-1, 1} (e.g., 0 -> -1, 1 -> 1).\n        *   Initialize sample weights `w_i = 1/N` for all `N` training samples.\n    *   **Boosting Rounds**: Loop `n_estimators` times:\n        1.  Train a decision stump (`h_t`) using `_find_best_stump` with current `sample_weights`.\n        2.  Calculate its weighted error `error_t`.\n        3.  Calculate the stump's voting weight `\u03b1_t = \u00bd \u00b7 ln((1 \u2013 error_t) / (error_t + 1e-10))`.\n        4.  Store the trained stump `h_t` and its weight `\u03b1_t`.\n        5.  **Early Stopping**: If `error_t == 0` (perfect stump), stop training.\n        6.  Update sample weights: `w_i \u2190 w_i \u00b7 exp(\u2013\u03b1_t \u00b7 y_i \u00b7 h_t(x_i))`.\n        7.  Normalize `sample_weights` so they sum to 1. If sum of weights becomes zero (e.g. due to numerical issues, though unlikely if `error_t <= 0.5`), stop.\n    *   **Prediction**:\n        *   For each sample in `X_test`, calculate the aggregated score: `\u03a3 \u03b1_t \u00b7 h_t(x)`.\n        *   Convert scores to final class labels {0, 1}: if score > 0, predict 1; otherwise (score <= 0), predict 0.\n    *   **Output**: Return predictions as a Python list of integers.\n\nThe implementation ensures that `error_t` (the error of the best stump found in a round) should be less than or equal to 0.5. This is because if a stump `h` has error `e > 0.5`, its opposite `-h` (achieved by flipping polarity) would have error `1-e < 0.5`, and `_find_best_stump` would choose `-h` or an even better stump. This property keeps `\u03b1_t` non-negative (or slightly negative if `error_t = 0.5` due to the `1e-10` term, which is consistent with the problem's formula).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Helper class for Decision Stump\nclass DecisionStump:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.feature_index: int | None = None\n        self.threshold: float | int | None = None # Can be int or float from data\n        self.polarity: int = 1  # 1 or -1\n        self.alpha: float | None = None # Weight of this stump in AdaBoost\n\n    def predict(self, X: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n        n_samples = X.shape[0]\n        # Default prediction is +1, then flip for samples not meeting condition\n        predictions = np.ones(n_samples, dtype=np.float64) \n\n        # These checks are mostly for robustness; main logic should ensure valid state.\n        if self.feature_index is None or self.threshold is None:\n            # This stump is not properly trained or initialized.\n            # This path should ideally not be taken if adaboost_predict works correctly.\n            # Return a default prediction or raise an error.\n            # For now, returning default +1s, but this indicates an issue.\n            return predictions\n\n        # Ensure X has features.

{"task_id": 178, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for minimizing the Sphere function, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Input Validation**: Check if `n_dims`, `num_particles`, and `num_iterations` are positive integers. If not, return `-1.0` (as a float, consistent with the function's return type).\n2.  **Parameter Initialization**: Set the PSO parameters: inertia weight `w=0.5`, cognitive weight `c1=1.5`, and social weight `c2=1.5`. Define the search space bounds `lower_bound = -1.0` and `upper_bound = 1.0`.\n3.  **RNG Initialization**: Initialize a random number generator `numpy.random.default_rng(seed)` to ensure deterministic behavior for a given seed.\n4.  **Sphere Function**: Define the Sphere function `f(x) = sum(x_i^2)`. This function will take a particle's position (a NumPy array) and return its objective value. It should handle both single particle positions (1D array) and multiple particle positions (2D array).\n5.  **Swarm Initialization**:\n    *   **Positions (`positions`)**: Initialize `num_particles` positions, each of `n_dims` dimensions. Values are drawn uniformly from `[lower_bound, upper_bound]`. This results in a `(num_particles, n_dims)` array.\n    *   **Velocities (`velocities`)**: Initialize velocities for all particles. A common and simple approach is to set initial velocities to zero. This results in a `(num_particles, n_dims)` array of zeros.\n    *   **Personal Bests (`p_best_positions`, `p_best_values`)**: Each particle's initial personal best position (`p_best_positions`) is its starting position. The corresponding personal best values (`p_best_values`) are calculated by applying the Sphere function to these positions.\n    *   **Global Best (`g_best_position`, `g_best_value`)**: The initial global best position (`g_best_position`) is the personal best position of the particle that has the minimum personal best value among the entire swarm. The `g_best_value` is this minimum value.\n6.  **PSO Iteration Loop**: For `num_iterations`:\n    *   **Generate Random Numbers**: For each particle and each dimension, generate two independent uniform random numbers, `r1` and `r2`, in the range `[0,1]`. These will be stored in `(num_particles, n_dims)` arrays.\n    *   **Update Velocities**: Apply the velocity update rule for all particles:\n        `v_new = w * v_current + c1 * r1 * (p_best_position - x_current) + c2 * r2 * (g_best_position - x_current)`\n        This update is performed element-wise for each dimension of each particle. `g_best_position` is broadcast appropriately.\n    *   **Update Positions**: Apply the position update rule for all particles:\n        `x_new = x_current + v_new`\n    *   **Clip Positions**: Ensure that the new positions stay within the defined search space `[lower_bound, upper_bound]` using `np.clip`.\n    *   **Evaluate Objective Function**: Calculate the Sphere function value for the new position of each particle.\n    *   **Update Personal Bests**: For each particle, if its new objective value is better (lower) than its `p_best_value`, update its `p_best_position` to the new position and `p_best_value` to the new value.\n    *   **Update Global Best**: Find the particle with the overall best `p_best_value` in the current swarm. If this value is better than the current `g_best_value`, update `g_best_value` and `g_best_position`.\n7.  **Return Value**: After all iterations, return the final `g_best_value`, rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThis implementation will be vectorized using NumPy for efficiency.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef particle_swarm_optimisation(n_dims: int,\n                                num_particles: int,\n                                num_iterations: int,\n                                seed: int = 1) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Minimises the n-dimensional Sphere function using Particle Swarm Optimisation.\n\n    Args:\n        n_dims: Dimensionality of the search space (>0).\n        num_particles: Number of particles in the swarm (>0).\n        num_iterations: Number of optimisation iterations (>0).\n        seed: Random-number-generator seed for reproducibility.\n\n    Returns:\n        The best objective value found, rounded to four decimals, or -1.0 on\n        invalid input (if any argument is non-positive or not an integer).\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

{"task_id": 180, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) algorithm as a pure function, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Convert the input feature matrices `X_train` and `X_test` to NumPy arrays for efficient numerical operations. `y_train` will be used as a Python list, as its elements can be strings or numbers.\n    *   Determine the number of training samples.\n\n2.  **Determine `effective_k`**:\n    *   According to Rule 2, if `k` is 0 or `k` is larger than the number of training samples, `effective_k` becomes the total number of training samples. Otherwise, `effective_k` is `k`.\n    *   If the training set is empty (`num_train_samples == 0`), `effective_k` will be 0. This edge case needs special handling for predictions.\n\n3.  **Iterate Through Test Samples**:\n    *   For each sample in `X_test`, we need to find its `effective_k` nearest neighbours from `X_train`.\n    *   **Handle Empty Training Set**: If `effective_k` is 0 (due to an empty `X_train`), predictions are made as follows:\n        *   For \"classification\": The problem doesn't specify what to return (as \"smallest label\" from an empty set is undefined). We'll return `None`.\n        *   For \"regression\": The mean of an empty set of values is undefined (NaN). We'll return `float('nan')`.\n    *   **Calculate Distances**: If `effective_k > 0`, calculate the Euclidean distance (Rule 1) from the current test sample to every sample in `X_train`. Store these distances along with their corresponding target values from `y_train`.\n    *   **Sort and Select Neighbours**: Sort the (distance, target) pairs based on distance in ascending order. Select the top `effective_k` pairs. These are the nearest neighbours.\n    *   **Make Prediction Based on Task**:\n        *   **Classification (Rule 3)**:\n            *   Among the target labels of the `effective_k` neighbours, find the frequency of each label using `collections.Counter`.\n            *   Identify the highest frequency.\n            *   Collect all labels that have this highest frequency.\n            *   Sort these tied labels using standard Python ordering (e.g., numerically for numbers, lexicographically for strings). The smallest one is the predicted label.\n        *   **Regression (Rule 4)**:\n            *   The target values of the `effective_k` neighbours (which should be numeric for regression) are averaged.\n            *   The resulting arithmetic mean is rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\n4.  **Collect Predictions**:\n    *   Store each prediction.

{"task_id": 184, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the CART decision tree classifier from scratch, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Node Representation**: Define a `Node` class to represent both decision nodes and leaf nodes in the tree. A leaf node will store a class value, while a decision node will store the feature index, threshold for splitting, and references to left and right child nodes.\n\n2.  **Gini Impurity**: Implement a function `_gini_impurity(y)` that calculates the Gini impurity of a set of labels `y`. Gini impurity is `1 - sum(p_i^2)`, where `p_i` is the proportion of samples of class `i`.\n\n3.  **Majority Class**: Implement `_majority_class(y)` to find the most frequent class label in `y`. In case of ties, it will pick the smallest class label due to `np.unique` sorting and `np.argmax` behavior.\n\n4.  **Gini Gain**: Implement `_gini_gain(y_parent, y_left, y_right)` to calculate the Gini gain of a split. Gain is `Gini(parent) - (w_left * Gini(left_child) + w_right * Gini(right_child))`.\n\n5.  **Find Best Split**: Implement `_find_best_split(X, y)`:\n    *   Iterate through each feature.\n    *   For each feature, sort its unique values. Potential thresholds are mid-points between consecutive unique values.\n    *   For each (feature, threshold) pair, split the data into left (`<= threshold`) and right (`> threshold`) subsets.\n    *   Calculate the Gini gain for this split.\n    *   The split (feature, threshold) that maximizes Gini gain is chosen.\n    *   If no split results in a positive Gini gain (i.e., `max_gain <= 0`), no split is made, and this function returns `None`.\n    *   A key property is that if a split results in an empty child, its Gini gain will be 0. Thus, such splits won't be chosen if any other split offers positive gain. If all splits offer 0 gain, the node becomes a leaf.\n\n6.  **Recursive Tree Building (`_build_tree_recursive`)**:\n    *   This function takes the current data subset `(X, y)` and current depth.\n    *   **Stopping Criteria**:\n        1.  If all labels in `y` are identical, create a leaf node with that label.\n        2.  If `max_depth` (if provided) is reached, create a leaf node with the majority class of `y`.\n        3.  Call `_find_best_split`. If it returns `None` (no split achieves positive Gini gain), create a leaf node with the majority class of `y`. This also covers the \"split produces an empty child\" scenario, as such splits yield 0 gain and won't be chosen if positive gain is possible. If all splits yield 0 gain, the node becomes a leaf.\n    *   **Recursive Step**: If a best split is found:\n        *   Create a decision node with the feature and threshold from the best split.\n        *   Recursively call `_build_tree_recursive` for the left and right children using their respective data subsets and an incremented depth. The children of this node will be the nodes returned by these recursive calls.\n\n7.  **Prediction (`_predict_sample_traverse`)**:\n    *   For a given test sample and a tree node:\n    *   If the node is a leaf, return its class value.\n    *   Otherwise, compare the sample's feature value (at `node.feature_index`) with `node.threshold`.\n    *   Traverse to the left or right child accordingly and repeat.\n    *   This is implemented iteratively to avoid Python's recursion depth limits for deep trees.\n\n8.  **Main Function (`decision_tree_predict`)**:\n    *   Handles initial calls and edge cases (e.g., empty training labels `y_train`).\n    *   Calls `_build_tree_recursive` to build the tree from `(X_train, y_train)`.\n    *   For each sample in `X_test`, calls `_predict_sample_traverse` to get its prediction.\n    *   Returns a list of these predictions.\n\nAll helper functions and the `Node` class are defined globally for clarity and self-containment within the script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Node class definition\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, feature_index=None, threshold=None, left=None, right=None, *, value=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Node in the decision tree.\n        If value is not None, it's a leaf node.\n        Otherwise, it's a decision node with feature_index, threshold, left and right children.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.feature_index = feature_index\n        self.threshold = threshold\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n        self.value = value  # Class label for a leaf node\n\n    def is_leaf_node(self):\n        return self.value is not None\n\n# Helper function to calculate Gini impurity for a set of labels\ndef _gini_impurity(y: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    if y.size == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    # Get unique class labels and their counts\n    _, counts = np.unique(y, return_counts=True)\n    # Calculate probabilities of each class\n    probabilities = counts / y.size\n    # Gini impurity formula: 1 - sum(p_i^2)\n    return 1.0 - np.sum(probabilities**2)\n\n# Helper function to determine the majority class in a set of labels\ndef _majority_class(y: np.ndarray) -> int:\n    if y.size == 0:\n        # This should be prevented by checks in calling functions.\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot compute majority class of an empty array.\")\n    \n    unique_labels, counts = np.unique(y, return_counts=True)\n    # np.argmax returns the index of the first occurrence in case of ties.\n    # Since unique_labels are sorted, this picks the smallest class label among ties.\n    return unique_labels[np.argmax(counts)]\n\n# Helper function to calculate Gini gain for a split\ndef _gini_gain(y_parent: np.ndarray, y_left: np.ndarray, y_right: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    parent_gini = _gini_impurity(y_parent)\n    \n    n_parent = y_parent.size\n    if n_parent == 0: # Should not happen if y_parent comes from a node with samples\n        return 0.0\n\n    n_left = y_left.size\n    n_right = y_right.size\n    \n    # Gini impurity of children; 0 if a child is empty\n    gini_left = _gini_impurity(y_left)\n    gini_right = _gini_impurity(y_right)\n    \n    # Weighted average of children's Gini impurities\n    weighted_children_gini = (n_left / n_parent) * gini_left + (n_right / n_parent) * gini_right\n    \n    # Gini gain: reduction in impurity\n    return parent_gini - weighted_children_gini\n\n# Helper function to find the best split for a node\ndef _find_best_split(X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray):\n    n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n    \n    if n_samples <= 1: # Not enough samples to split\n        return None\n\n    best_split_info = {} # To store info about the best split found\n    max_gain = 0.0  # Initialize max_gain; a split is only useful if gain > 0\n\n    for feature_idx in range(n_features):\n        feature_values = X[:, feature_idx]\n        # Sort unique values to find potential thresholds\n        unique_sorted_values = np.unique(feature_values)\n\n        if len(unique_sorted_values) <= 1: # Feature has only one unique value, cannot split\n            continue\n            \n        # Potential thresholds are mid-points between consecutive unique sorted values\n        potential_thresholds = (unique_sorted_values[:-1] + unique_sorted_values[1:]) / 2.0\n\n        for threshold in potential_thresholds:\n            # Split data based on current feature and threshold\n            left_indices = np.where(feature_values <= threshold)[0]\n            right_indices = np.where(feature_values > threshold)[0]\n\n            # If a split results in an empty child (all samples go to the other child),\n            # its Gini gain will be 0.

{"task_id": 190, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To find the best Gini split, we need to iterate through each feature and each unique value within that feature, treating it as a potential threshold. For each such candidate split, we calculate the weighted Gini impurity. We keep track of the split (feature index, threshold value) that yields the minimum Gini impurity, respecting specified tie-breaking rules.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the implementation steps:\n\n1.  **Input Handling**:\n    *   Convert input `X` (features) and `y` (labels) to NumPy arrays for efficient numerical operations.\n    *   Ensure `X` is a 2D array. If `X` is 1D, reshape it to `n_samples x 1` (assuming it represents multiple samples for a single feature).\n    *   Get the number of samples (`n_samples`) and features (`n_features`).\n    *   Handle the edge case of `n_samples == 0`. In this scenario, no split is possible. The Gini impurity of an empty dataset is 0.\n\n2.  **Gini Impurity Calculation**:\n    *   Implement a helper function `calculate_gini(labels_node)`:\n        *   It takes a 1D array of labels for a specific node.\n        *   If the node is empty, its Gini impurity is 0.\n        *   Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of each class, calculates the proportion `p_k` for each class `k`, and computes Gini impurity as `1 - \u03a3_k (p_k^2)`.\n    *   Calculate `gini_whole_dataset`, the Gini impurity of the entire dataset before any splits. This is needed if no valid split is found.\n\n3.  **Iterating Through Candidate Splits**:\n    *   Initialize variables to store the best split found: `best_feature_index`, `best_threshold_value`, and `best_gini_split_val` (initialized to infinity).\n    *   Use a flag `found_valid_split` to track if at least one valid split (resulting in non-empty children) is encountered.\n    *   Outer loop: Iterate through each `feature_idx` from `0` to `n_features - 1`.\n        *   Extract the current `feature_column` from `X_np`.\n        *   Determine `unique_threshold_candidates` by finding all unique values in `feature_column`. `np.unique` conveniently returns sorted unique values.\n    *   Inner loop: Iterate through each `threshold` in `unique_threshold_candidates`.\n        *   Define the split:\n            *   `left_mask = feature_column <= threshold`\n            *   `right_mask = feature_column > threshold`\n        *   **Validity Check**: Skip this candidate split if `left_mask` or `right_mask` results in an empty child node (i.e., all samples go to one side). This is checked using `np.any()`.\n        *   If the split is valid, set `found_valid_split = True`.\n        *   Extract `y_left` and `y_right` (labels for the child nodes).\n        *   Calculate `gini_left` and `gini_right` using the helper function.\n        *   Calculate the `current_weighted_gini` for this split: `(n_left / n_total) * G(left) + (n_right / n_total) * G(right)`.\n\n4.  **Updating Best Split and Tie-Breaking**:\n    *   Compare `current_weighted_gini` with `best_gini_split_val`:\n        *   If `current_weighted_gini` is strictly smaller (by more than `1e-12` to handle float precision), update `best_gini_split_val`, `best_feature_index`, and `best_threshold_value`.\n        *   If `current_weighted_gini` is approximately equal (difference less than `1e-12`):\n            *   If `feature_idx` is smaller than `best_feature_index`, update all three best-split variables.\n            *   If `feature_idx` is also equal, and `threshold` is smaller than `best_threshold_value`, update `best_threshold_value` (Gini and feature index are already the same).\n\n5.  **Return Result**:\n    *   After all iterations, if `found_valid_split` is `False` (meaning no valid split could be made), return `(-1, None, round(gini_whole_dataset, 4))`.\n    *   Otherwise, return `(best_feature_index, float(best_threshold_value), round(best_gini_split_val, 4))`. The threshold is cast to a standard Python float, and the Gini impurity is rounded to 4 decimal places as required.\n\nThis approach systematically evaluates all specified candidate splits and adheres to the Gini calculation and tie-breaking rules.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef best_gini_split(X, y):\n    \"\"\"Find the best feature index and threshold that minimise the weighted Gini impurity.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X : list[list[float]] or numpy.ndarray\n        A 2-D structure where each inner list/row contains the numerical\n        feature values of one sample.\n    y : list[int] or numpy.ndarray\n        A 1-D structure containing the class labels corresponding to the rows\n        of X.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple\n        A tuple `(best_feature_index, best_threshold_value, best_gini)` where\n        `best_gini` is rounded to 4 decimal places.

{"task_id": 191, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To create the distance metric factory, we will implement the `metric` function. This function will take a metric `name` as a string and return a callable `d`. The callable `d` will be responsible for both validating its two input vectors and computing the specified distance if the inputs are valid.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the implementation:\n\n1.  **`metric(name: str)` function**:\n    *   This outer function acts as the factory.\n    *   It defines the actual distance calculation logic for each supported metric (Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev, Cosine). These are helper functions that assume valid, pre-processed NumPy arrays as input.\n    *   It stores these calculation functions in a dictionary, mapping metric names to functions.\n    *   It defines an inner function, `d(vec1, vec2)`, which will be the callable returned by the factory. This inner function `d` forms a closure, capturing the `name` and the dictionary of calculation functions from its enclosing scope.\n    *   `metric` then returns `d`.\n\n2.  **Inner callable `d(vec1, vec2)`**:\n    *   **Metric Name Validation**: It first checks if the `name` (captured from the `metric` function call) is one of the supported metric names. If not, it returns -1.\n    *   **Input Type Validation**: It verifies that `vec1` and `vec2` are instances of `list`, `tuple`, or `np.ndarray`. If not, it returns -1.\n    *   **Numeric Conversion and Validation**: It attempts to convert `vec1` and `vec2` into 1D NumPy arrays with `dtype=float`. This step also implicitly checks if the elements are numeric and can be converted to floats. If conversion fails (e.g., due to non-numeric elements), it returns -1.\n    *   **Dimensionality Validation**: It checks if the resulting NumPy arrays are strictly one-dimensional (`ndim == 1`). If not (e.g., scalars or multi-dimensional arrays), it returns -1.\n    *   **Non-Empty Validation**: It ensures that the vectors are not empty. Since they are 1D at this point, checking `shape[0] == 0` for the first vector is sufficient. If it's empty, it returns -1.\n    *   **Length Equality Validation**: It checks if both vectors have the same length (`x_np.shape[0] == y_np.shape[0]`). If `x_np` was non-empty but `y_np` was empty, this check would catch it. If lengths differ, it returns -1.\n    *   **Cosine-Specific Validation**: If the metric is 'cosine', it calculates the L2 norm of both vectors. If either norm is zero, it returns -1.\n    *   **Distance Calculation**: If all validations pass, it selects the appropriate calculation function based on `name` and computes the distance.\n        *   For cosine distance, to enhance numerical stability, the similarity value is clipped to the range `[-1.0, 1.0]` before calculating `1 - similarity`.\n    *   **Result Handling**:\n        *   If the calculation results in `NaN` or `infinity` (which is unlikely with the given validations but checked for robustness), it returns -1.\n        *   Otherwise, the computed distance is rounded to four decimal places and returned.\n    *   Any unexpected exceptions during calculation also lead to a return value of -1.\n\nThis structure ensures that all validation logic is encapsulated within the returned callable `d`, as per the requirements.

{"task_id": 198, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "The task is to implement the M-step for updating the word-topic matrix $\\beta$ in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The formula given is:\n$$\n\\beta_{v,t}\\;\\propto\\;\\sum_{d=0}^{D-1}\\sum_{n=0}^{N_d-1}\\;\\varphi^{(d)}_{n,t}\\,[\\,w^{(d)}_n=v\\,]\n$$\nwhere $v$ is a word index, $t$ is a topic index, $d$ is a document index, and $n$ is a token index within a document. $\\varphi^{(d)}_{n,t}$ is the variational parameter (probability that token $n$ in document $d$ comes from topic $t$), and $[\\,w^{(d)}_n=v\\,]$ is an indicator function that is 1 if the $n$-th token of document $d$ is word $v$, and 0 otherwise. After computing this sum for all $v, t$, each column of $\\beta$ (corresponding to a topic $t$) must be normalized so that $\\sum_{v=0}^{V-1}\\beta_{v,t}=1$. The final matrix entries must be rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\nThe implementation will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine Dimensions**:\n    *   $V$ (vocabulary size) is given.\n    *   $T$ (number of topics) can be inferred from the shape of the $\\varphi^{(d)}$ matrices (e.g., `phi[0].shape[1]`). If `phi` is empty, $T=0$.\n    *   Handle edge cases: If $V=0$, return an empty list. If $T=0$, return a list of $V$ empty lists.\n\n2.  **Initialize $\\beta_{unnormalized}$**: Create a $V \\times T$ matrix of zeros using `numpy.zeros` with `dtype=np.float64` for precision during accumulation.\n\n3.  **Accumulate Sums**:\n    *   Iterate through each document $d$ in the `corpus` and its corresponding `phi[d]`.\n    *   For each token $w^{(d)}_n$ (word index `corpus[d][n]`) in document $d$:\n        *   Let $v = w^{(d)}_n$.\n        *   If $v$ is within the valid vocabulary range $[0, V-1)$:\n            *   Add the vector $\\varphi^{(d)}_{n,:} = [\\varphi^{(d)}_{n,0}, \\dots, \\varphi^{(d)}_{n,T-1}]$ (which is `phi[d][n, :]`) to the $v$-th row of $\\beta_{unnormalized}$.

Let `num_occurring_words` be the count of such words.\n\n4.  **Normalize Columns**:\n    *   Create a new $V \\times T$ matrix $\\beta_{normalized}$, initialized to zeros.\n    *   For each topic $t$ (each column of $\\beta_{unnormalized}$):\n        *   Calculate the sum of the $t$-th column: $S_t = \\sum_{v=0}^{V-1} \\beta_{unnormalized}[v,t]$.\n        *   **If $S_t > 0$**:\n            *   Normalize the column: $\\beta_{normalized}[v,t] = \\beta_{unnormalized}[v,t] / S_t$.\n            *   The accumulation step ensures that if a word $v^*$ never occurs, $\\beta_{unnormalized}[v^*,t]$ is 0. This property is preserved by normalization, so $\\beta_{normalized}[v^*,t]$ will also be 0, satisfying the constraint \"If a word index ... never occurs ... row ... must contain only zeros\".\n        *   **If $S_t = 0$**: (This means $\\beta_{unnormalized}[v,t]=0$ for all $v$ for this topic $t$)\n            *   The problem states: \"If a word index ... never occurs ... row ... must contain only zeros (but columns must still sum to one after normalisation of the non-zero rows).\"\n            *   And an \"Output Constraint\" is: \"Every column must sum to exactly 1\".\n            *   Interpreting these:\n                *   If `num_occurring_words > 0`: Distribute the probability mass $1.0$ uniformly among the `num_occurring_words`. For $v$ that occurred, set $\\beta_{normalized}[v,t] = 1 / \\text{num_occurring_words}$. For $v$ that did not occur, $\\beta_{normalized}[v,t]$ remains $0$.

All rows must be zero. Thus, the column $\\beta_{normalized}[:,t]$ remains all zeros. In this specific scenario, the column sum will be 0, which conflicts with the \"Output Constraint\" if $T>0, V>0$.

{"task_id": 202, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "The Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm, also known as k-medoids, is a clustering algorithm similar to k-means. Instead of using cluster centroids (which are means of points in a cluster and may not correspond to actual data samples), PAM uses medoids, which are actual data samples that are most centrally located within their clusters.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Select `k` initial medoids. The problem specifies a deterministic approach: use the first `k` samples of the input data `X` as the initial medoids. The indices of these medoids will be `0, 1, ..., k-1`.\n\n2.  **Assignment (Implicit in Cost Calculation)**:\n    *   Each data sample is assigned to the cluster represented by the closest medoid. Euclidean distance is used as the distance metric.\n    *   **Tie-breaking rule for assignment**: If a sample is equidistant to two or more medoids, it is assigned to the cluster whose medoid appears first in the current list of medoids. The labels assigned are `0, ..., k-1`, corresponding to the order of medoids in this list.\n\n3.  **Cost Calculation**:\n    *   The total clustering cost is defined as the sum of the Euclidean distances between every sample and the medoid of the cluster it belongs to (respecting the tie-breaking rule).\n\n4.  **Iterative Improvement (Swap Phase)**:\n    *   The algorithm repeatedly attempts to improve the quality of the medoids by reducing the total clustering cost.\n    *   In each iteration, consider all possible swaps between a current medoid and a non-medoid sample.\n        *   For each pair `(m, p)` where `m` is a current medoid and `p` is a non-medoid sample:\n            *   Temporarily replace `m` with `p` in the set of medoids. The new medoid `p` takes the \"position\" (and thus the label index) of the old medoid `m` in the list of medoids.\n            *   Recalculate the total clustering cost with this new set of medoids.\n            *   Determine the cost reduction achieved by this swap.\n    *   Identify the swap that results in the largest cost reduction.\n    *   **Acceptance criteria**: If this largest cost reduction is strictly positive (i.e., the new cost is strictly lower than the cost before any swaps in this iteration), perform this single best swap. The set of medoids is updated.\n    *   If no swap can strictly decrease the total cost, the algorithm has converged, and this phase stops.\n\n5.  **Final Labeling**:\n    *   After convergence, assign each sample a final cluster label. The label is the index (`0, ..., k-1`) of the closest medoid in the final list of medoids, using the same tie-breaking rule as in step 2.\n\nThe implementation will involve a main loop for the iterative improvement phase. Inside this loop, all possible `k * (n_samples - k)` swaps are evaluated. For each potential swap, the total cost is recomputed by assigning all `n_samples` to the `k` potential medoids.\n\nA helper function, `_assign_samples_and_calculate_cost`, will be used to compute the total cost and assign labels for a given set of medoids. This function will handle the Euclidean distance calculation and the specified tie-breaking rule.\n\nThe process is deterministic due to:\n*   Fixed initial medoids.\n*   Fixed tie-breaking rule for sample assignment.\n*   Systematic evaluation of all swaps and selection of the one with the greatest *strict* cost reduction. If multiple swaps offer the same maximal reduction, the one encountered first due to the loop order (iterating medoids to swap out, then non-medoids to swap in) will be chosen.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _assign_samples_and_calculate_cost(X_data: np.ndarray, \n                                       current_medoid_indices: list[int], \n                                       n_samples: int, \n                                       k_clusters: int) -> tuple[float, list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Assigns each sample to the closest medoid and calculates the total cost.\n    Tie-breaking: chooses the medoid that appears first in current_medoid_indices.\n    Labels are 0 to k_clusters-1, corresponding to the order in current_medoid_indices.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_cost = 0.0\n    # Initialize labels array.

{"task_id": 216, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement Elastic Net linear regression from scratch, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Input Validation and Preprocessing**:\n    *   Convert `x_train`, `y_train`, and `x_test` into NumPy arrays. Handle potential `ValueError` if conversion fails (e.g., non-numeric data).\n    *   Ensure `y_train` is a 1D array.\n    *   Validate `n_iterations`: must be 1 or greater.\n    *   Validate the shapes of `x_train` and `x_test`:\n        *   Input matrices should be 2D (list of lists, where each sublist is a sample).\n        *   Handle empty inputs (e.g., `[]`) by treating them as matrices with 0 samples and 0 features, appropriately shaped for further processing (e.g., `np.empty((0,0))`).\n        *   The number of original features in `x_train` and `x_test` must be identical.\n        *   The number of samples in `x_train` must match the length of `y_train`.\n    *   If any validation fails, return `-1`.\n\n2.  **Polynomial Feature Generation**:\n    *   Create a helper function `_create_polynomial_features(X, degree)`.\n    *   For each original feature column `x_j` in the input matrix `X`, generate new features `x_j, x_j^2, ..., x_j^degree`.\n    *   Concatenate these new features for all original columns to form the polynomial feature matrix.\n    *   Apply this to both `x_train_arr_proc` and `x_test_arr_proc`.\n    *   If `degree` is 1, this step effectively returns the original features.\n    *   Handle cases with no original features (input `X` has shape `(N,0)`), resulting in an output with no polynomial features (shape `(N,0)`).\n\n3.  **Feature Scaling (Standardization)**:\n    *   Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each column (polynomial feature) of the *training* data (`x_train_poly`).\n    *   If there are no training samples (`m=0`), scaling parameters cannot be learned. In this scenario, transformed test features will be set to zero.\n    *   If a feature in the training set is constant (standard deviation is zero), its scaled version (both for train and test) will be zero.\n    *   Scale `x_train_poly` using the calculated means and standard deviations: `(feature - mean) / std`.\n    *   Scale `x_test_poly` using the *same* means and standard deviations derived from the training data.\n\n4.  **Bias Term Addition**:\n    *   Add a column of ones (bias term) as the first column to both the scaled training features (`x_train_scaled`) and scaled test features (`x_test_scaled`). This results in `X_train_final` and `X_test_final`.\n\n5.  **Model Training (Batch Gradient Descent)**:\n    *   Initialize the weight vector `w` (including the bias weight) to zeros. The length of `w` will be `1 (bias) + num_polynomial_features`.\n    *   If there are no training samples (`m=0`), skip the training loop; weights remain zero.\n    *   Calculate L1 penalty strength (`alpha1 = reg_factor * l1_ratio`) and L2 penalty strength (`alpha2 = reg_factor * (1 - l1_ratio)`).\n    *   Iterate `n_iterations` times:\n        *   Calculate predictions on the training set: `y_pred_train = X_train_final @ w`.\n        *   Calculate the error: `error = y_pred_train - y_train_arr`.\n        *   Calculate the gradient of the Mean Squared Error (MSE): `grad_mse = (1/m) * X_train_final.T @ error`.\n        *   Initialize the total gradient `dw` with `grad_mse`.\n        *   For non-bias weights (`w[1:]`):\n            *   Add L1 penalty sub-gradient: `alpha1 * np.sign(w[1:])`. `np.sign(0)` is 0, as required.\n            *   Add L2 penalty gradient: `alpha2 * w[1:]`.\n        *   Update weights: `w = w - learning_rate * dw`.\n\n6.  **Prediction**:\n    *   If there are no test samples (`n_test_samples=0`), return an empty list.\n    *   Calculate predictions for `X_test_final` using the learned weights `w`: `y_test_pred = X_test_final @ w`.\n    *   Round the predictions to four decimal places.\n    *   Return the predictions as a Python list.\n\nThe implementation will place the `_create_polynomial_features` helper function inside `elastic_net_regression` to keep the solution self-contained in a single function.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef elastic_net_regression(x_train, y_train, x_test, degree=1, reg_factor=0.05, l1_ratio=0.5, n_iterations=3000, learning_rate=0.01):\n    \"\"\"Elastic Net regression implemented with batch gradient descent.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x_train : list[list[float]] | np.ndarray\n        Training feature matrix where each sub-list is a sample.\n    y_train : list[float] | np.ndarray\n        Target values for every row in `x_train`.\n    x_test : list[list[float]] | np.ndarray\n        Matrix of samples to predict after training.\n    degree : int, default 1\n        Degree of polynomial expansion applied to every original feature.\n    reg_factor : float, default 0.05\n        Overall regularisation strength (alpha).\n    l1_ratio : float, default 0.5\n        Portion of L1 penalty in Elastic Net (0 = pure ridge, 1 = pure lasso).\n    n_iterations : int, default 3000\n        Number of gradient descent iterations.\n    learning_rate : float, default 0.01\n        Step size used in each gradient update.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    list[float]\n        Predictions for `x_test` rounded to 4 decimals.

{"task_id": 218, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To determine the outcome of a Blackjack hand, we need to implement a function `blackjack_outcome` that takes the player's and dealer's final hands and returns the player's reward. This involves several steps:\n\n1.  **Card and Hand Representation**: Cards are integers from 1 (Ace) to 10. A hand is a list of these integers.\n\n2.  **Hand Value Calculation**:\n    *   The basic value is the sum of the cards.\n    *   Aces (card value 1) are special: If the hand contains at least one Ace, and treating one Ace as 11 (instead of 1) results in a total sum of 21 or less, then one Ace is counted as 11. Otherwise, all Aces count as 1.\n    *   The goal is to get the highest possible score that is not over 21. If all possible scores are over 21, the hand is a \"bust\".\n    *   A helper function, say `_calculate_hand_value(hand)`, will be useful for this. It should take a hand (list of integers) and return its score.\n        *   Initial sum: Calculate sum with all Aces as 1.\n        *   Usable Ace: If the hand contains an Ace and `initial_sum + 10 <= 21`, then the score becomes `initial_sum + 10` (effectively changing one Ace from 1 to 11). Otherwise, the score is `initial_sum`.\n\n3.  **Special Terms**:\n    *   **Bust**: A hand score greater than 21.\n    *   **Natural Blackjack**: A two-card hand consisting of one Ace (1) and one 10-value card (10). Its score is always 21.\n    *   A helper function, `_is_natural_blackjack(hand)`, can check this. It verifies `len(hand) == 2` and the presence of both a 1 and a 10.\n\n4.  **Reward Rules Implementation**: The main function `blackjack_outcome` will use the helper functions to get scores and natural status, then apply the rules in order:\n\n    *   Calculate `player_score` and `dealer_score`.\n    *   Determine if the player has a `player_has_natural` blackjack.\n\n    *   **Rule 1**: If `player_score > 21` (player busts), player loses. Reward: -1.0.\n    *   **Rule 2**: If `dealer_score > 21` (dealer busts, and player has not), player wins. Reward: +1.0. (This rule is applied only if Rule 1 is false).\n    *   **Rule 3**: Otherwise (neither player nor dealer has busted), compare scores:\n        *   If `player_score > dealer_score`: Player wins.\n            *   **Rule 4**: If `player_has_natural`, reward is +1.5.\n            *   Else (player wins without natural), reward is +1.0.\n        *   If `player_score < dealer_score`: Player loses. Reward: -1.0.\n        *   If `player_score == dealer_score`: It's a draw. Reward: 0.0. (Rule 4 specifies no extra bonus for a drawn natural blackjack, which is consistent with a 0.0 reward for any draw).\n\nThe function will return a float value: -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, or 1.5.\n\nLet's structure the code with these components.

{"task_id": 222, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the sigmoid function with the specified requirements, we need to consider several aspects:\n1.  **Input Types**: The function must handle single numeric values (`int`, `float`), Python lists of numbers, and NumPy arrays.\n2.  **Element-wise Operation**: For list or array inputs, the sigmoid function should be applied to each element.\n3.  **Numerical Stability**: The implementation must be stable for very large positive or negative inputs. The standard sigmoid formula is `1 / (1 + exp(-z))`.\n    *   For large positive `z`, `exp(-z)` is very small (approaches 0), and the formula is stable, yielding a result close to 1.\n    *   For large negative `z`, `-z` is large positive. `exp(-z)` becomes extremely large, potentially causing overflow in `1 + exp(-z)`.\n    *   A common numerically stable approach is to use an alternative but mathematically equivalent formula for `z < 0`: `exp(z) / (1 + exp(z))`. For large negative `z`, `exp(z)` is very small, and this formula stably yields a result close to 0.\n4.  **Return Types and Rounding**:\n    *   If the input is a Python scalar (`int` or `float`), the output must be a single `float`, rounded to 4 decimal places.\n    *   If the input is a list or a NumPy array (this includes NumPy scalar types like `np.float64` or 0-dimensional arrays like `np.array(5)` as they are not Python `int` or `float`), the output must be a Python `list`. All numeric values within this list must be rounded to 4 decimal places. The list should maintain the same nested structure as the input.\n    *   A special case arises for inputs like NumPy 0-dimensional arrays or NumPy scalar types (e.g., `np.float64(x)`). These are not Python `int`/`float`, so they fall under the \"otherwise\" category, requiring a `list` output. If their `tolist()` representation is a scalar (which it is for 0-dim arrays), this scalar must be wrapped in a list (e.g., `[value]`) to satisfy the \"return a Python list\" rule.\n\n**Implementation Plan**:\n1.  Check if the input `z` is a Python `int` or `float`.\n    *   If yes, compute the sigmoid value using the numerically stable conditions (`z >= 0` vs `z < 0`), round it to 4 decimal places, and return the float.\n2.  If `z` is not a Python `int` or `float`, it's treated as an array-like input (list, NumPy array, NumPy scalar type).\n    *   Convert `z` to a NumPy array with `dtype=float`. This handles lists, existing NumPy arrays, and NumPy scalar types (which become 0-dim arrays). A `try-except` block can catch conversion errors (e.g., for jagged lists or non-numeric data).\n    *   Apply the numerically stable sigmoid function element-wise. NumPy's boolean indexing or `np.where` can be used:\n        *   For elements `val >= 0`, use `1 / (1 + np.exp(-val))`.\n        *   For elements `val < 0`, use `np.exp(val) / (1 + np.exp(val))`.\n    *   Round all elements of the resulting NumPy array to 4 decimal places using `np.round()`.\n    *   Convert the rounded NumPy array to a Python list using `.tolist()`. This preserves the nested structure for 1D/2D arrays and converts 0-dim arrays to Python scalars.\n    *   Since the rule is \"if not Python int/float input, return list\", check if the result from `.tolist()` is already a list. If it's a scalar (because the input was, e.g., `np.array(5)` or `np.float64(5.0)`), wrap it in a single-element list (e.g., `[scalar_value]`).

{"task_id": 224, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the Leaky ReLU activation function, we need to handle three types of input for `z`: Python scalars (int/float), Python lists (possibly nested), and NumPy `ndarray`s. The function should also accept an optional slope parameter `a` for negative inputs, defaulting to 0.01. The core definition of Leaky ReLU is `f(x) = x` if `x >= 0`, and `f(x) = a*x` if `x < 0`.\n\nThe crucial output constraints are:\n1.  The function must always return a Python list.\n2.  This list must have the same nested structure as the input `z`.\n3.  If `z` is a NumPy `ndarray`, its `tolist()` method should be used for conversion.\n\nLet's break down the implementation strategy:\n\n1.  **Helper Function for Scalar Transformation**: It's useful to have a small helper function, say `_apply_leaky_relu_to_scalar(x, slope_a)`, that takes a single number `x` and the slope `a`, and returns the transformed number. This function will encapsulate the Leaky ReLU logic for a single element.\n\n2.  **Handling Python Scalar Input `z`**:\n    If `z` is an `int` or `float`, we apply the Leaky ReLU transformation to it using the helper. Since the main function must always return a list, the transformed scalar value will be wrapped in a list, e.g., `[transformed_z]`.\n\n3.  **Handling Python List Input `z`**:\n    If `z` is a list, we iterate through its elements.\n    *   If an element is a number, we transform it using the scalar helper and add the result to our new list.\n    *   If an element is another list (indicating nesting), we make a recursive call to `leaky_relu` with this sub-list. The result of this recursive call (which will be a list) is then added to our new list.\n    This approach preserves the nested structure. For example, if `z = [1, [-2, 3]]`, the output will be `[leaky_relu(1), leaky_relu([-2, 3])]` where the first part resolves to a transformed number and the second part resolves to a transformed list like `[transformed_(-2), transformed_(3)]`.\n\n4.  **Handling NumPy `ndarray` Input `z`**:\n    If `z` is an `ndarray`, NumPy's vectorized operations are efficient. We can use `np.where(z >= 0, z, z * a)` to apply the Leaky ReLU transformation element-wise.\n    The result is another `ndarray`. We then call its `tolist()` method to convert it into a Python list.\n    A special consideration for `ndarray`s is when they are 0-dimensional (e.g., `np.array(5)`). The `tolist()` method for a 0-D array returns a scalar (e.g., `5`), not a list. To satisfy the \"always return a Python list\" constraint, if the input `ndarray` was 0-D, we must wrap this scalar result in a list (e.g., `[5]`). For N-D arrays (N > 0), `tolist()` already produces a list.\n\n5.  **Parameter `a`**: The slope `a` defaults to `0.01`. The problem states `a` is a positive float in `[0,1)`. This implies `a \\in (0,1)`. The default value fits this. No validation of `a` is required by the problem statement.\n\n6.  **Error Handling**: For robustness, type checks for `z` and elements within lists are good practice. If `z` is not one of the three expected types, or if a list contains elements that are not numbers or sub-lists, raising a `TypeError` is appropriate.\n\nThis plan ensures that the function adheres to all specified requirements, particularly the output format and structure. The \"same shape\" requirement is interpreted in conjunction with the \"always return a list\" and \"same nested structure\" rules. For scalar inputs or 0-D arrays, returning `[transformed_value]` satisfies \"return a list\" and \"same nested structure\" (as scalars/0-D arrays have no nesting, so a flat list is structurally consistent).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Helper function to apply Leaky ReLU to a single scalar number.\n# This function assumes 'x' is a number (int or float).\ndef _apply_leaky_relu_to_scalar(x, slope_a):\n    \"\"\"Applies Leaky ReLU to a single number x using slope_a for negative values.\"\"\"\n    if x >= 0:\n        return x\n    else:\n        # slope_a is a float, so the multiplication result will be a float\n        # if x is an int, or float if x is already a float.\n        return x * slope_a\n\ndef leaky_relu(z, a=0.01):\n    \"\"\"Apply the Leaky ReLU activation to every element in *z*.\n\n    Args:\n        z: A scalar, list (possibly nested) or ``numpy.ndarray`` of numbers.\n        a: Optional float in [0,1) \u2014 the slope for negative inputs.

If not, it returns `-1`.\n2.  **Matrix `A` Preparation**:\n    *   The input `shape` `(d0, d1, ..., dn)` is used to define the dimensions of a 2D matrix `A`.\n    *   `d0` will be the first dimension of `A`.\n    *   The second dimension of `A` will be the product of the remaining dimensions of `shape`, i.e., `d1 * d2 * ... * dn`.\n    *   Matrix `A` is then filled with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from a standard normal distribution (`N(0,1)`).\n3.  **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**:\n    *   The SVD of `A` is computed: `A = U \u03a3 V\u1d40`.\n    *   We use the \"thin\" SVD, where `U` has dimensions `(d0, k)` and `V\u1d40` (denoted `Vh` in NumPy) has dimensions `(k, d1...dn)`, with `k = min(d0, d1...dn)`.\n4.  **Choosing Matrix `Q`**:\n    *   The core of the orthogonalization process lies in selecting either `U` or `V\u1d40`. The rule is: `Q = U` if `U.shape == A.shape`, otherwise `Q = V\u1d40`.\n    *   Let `A` be `m \u00d7 n_prod` (where `m=d0`, `n_prod=d1...dn`). `U` is `m \u00d7 k` and `V\u1d40` is `k \u00d7 n_prod`, where `k = min(m, n_prod)`.\n    *   `U.shape == A.shape` implies `k == n_prod`.

The network architecture and specific weight/bias values are given: all weights are 1.0, and all biases are 0.0.\n\nThe network consists of:\n1.  A shared feature extractor with three dense layers (ReLU activation).\n2.  An actor head (Dense layer with Softmax activation) outputting action probabilities.\n3.  A critic head (Dense layer with no activation) outputting the state value.\n\nLet's break down the calculations step-by-step:\n\n**Input:** `state` (a list of 3 floats, e.g., `[s\u2080, s\u2081, s\u2082]`). This will be converted to a 1x3 NumPy row vector `s_np`.\n\n**Shared Feature Extractor:**\n\n1.  **Dense-1 (input \u2192 4 neurons, ReLU):**\n    *   Weights `W\u2081`: 3x4 matrix of ones.\n    *   Biases `b\u2081`: 4-element vector of zeros.\n    *   Linear transformation: `z\u2081_lin = s_np @ W\u2081 + b\u2081`.\n        If `s_np = [[s\u2080, s\u2081, s\u2082]]`, then `s_np @ W\u2081` results in a 1x4 vector where each element is `s\u2080+s\u2081+s\u2082`. Adding `b\u2081` (zeros) doesn't change this.\n    *   Activation: `z\u2081 = ReLU(z\u2081_lin)`. Each element of `z\u2081` becomes `max(0, s\u2080+s\u2081+s\u2082)`.

{"task_id": 249, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the forward pass of an Actor-Critic network using NumPy, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Convert the input `state` (a list of floats) and all network parameters (weights `W` and biases `b` from the `params` dictionary) into NumPy arrays. We'll use `np.float64` for precision during intermediate calculations.\n\n2.  **Shared Layers**: The network has three shared fully-connected (dense) layers. Each layer performs an affine transformation (`output = input @ W + b`) followed by a ReLU activation (`ReLU(x) = max(0, x)`).\n    *   The input `state` is fed into the first shared layer.\n    *   The output of each shared layer becomes the input to the next.\n    *   The output of the third shared layer is the `final_hidden_vec`.\n\n3.  **Actor Head**: This head takes `final_hidden_vec` as input.\n    *   It performs a dense transformation (`actor_scores = final_hidden_vec @ Wa + ba`).\n    *   The resulting `actor_scores` are then passed through a softmax function to produce a probability distribution over actions. The softmax function is `softmax(x_i) = exp(x_i) / sum(exp(x_j))`. For numerical stability, we subtract the maximum score from all scores before exponentiating: `softmax(x_i) = exp(x_i - max(x)) / sum(exp(x_j - max(x)))`.\n\n4.  **Critic Head**: This head also takes `final_hidden_vec` as input.\n    *   It performs a dense transformation (`value_output = final_hidden_vec @ Wc + bc`).\n    *   The output is a single scalar representing the estimated state value.

Other values like `round(0.12345, 4)` become `0.1235`, and `round(0.12, 4)` become `0.12`.

{"task_id": 266, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To build an adjacency list for an undirected graph from a list of vertices `V` and a list of edges `E`, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Map Vertices to Indices**: Create a mapping from each vertex in `V` to its index. This is crucial because the output requires neighbors to be sorted based on their original order in `V`. A dictionary `vertex_to_index = {vertex: i for i, vertex in enumerate(V)}` serves this purpose.\n\n2.  **Initialize Adjacency Storage**: We need a temporary structure to store neighbors for each vertex. A dictionary `adj_map` where keys are vertices from `V` and values are sets of their neighbors is ideal. Using sets ensures that neighbors are unique, automatically handling any parallel/duplicate edges specified in `E`. Initialize this map for all vertices in `V`, so even disconnected vertices (those with no edges) are accounted for: `adj_map = {vertex: set() for vertex in V}`.\n\n3.  **Process Edges**: Iterate through each edge `(u, v)` in the edge list `E`. Since the graph is undirected, an edge `(u, v)` means `v` is a neighbor of `u`, and `u` is a neighbor of `v`. Add `v` to `adj_map[u]` and `u` to `adj_map[v]`. The problem implies that vertices `u` and `v` in `E` are members of `V`. If `u` or `v` were not in `V` (and thus not keys in `adj_map`), this step would raise a `KeyError`, which is an appropriate response to malformed input under this assumption.\n\n4.  **Construct the Final Adjacency List**:\n    *   The final result `G` must be a list of lists.\n    *   Iterate through the vertices in `V` in their original order. For each `vertex` from `V`:\n        *   Retrieve its set of neighbors from `adj_map[vertex]`.\n        *   Convert this set of neighbors into a list.\n        *   Sort this list. The sorting key for a neighbor `n` should be its original index in `V`, i.e., `vertex_to_index[n]`.\n        *   Append this sorted list of neighbors to `G`.\n    *   If a vertex has no neighbors, its entry in `adj_map` will be an empty set, which, when converted and sorted, results in an empty list `[]`, satisfying the requirement.\n\nThis approach ensures that the outer list `G` preserves the order of `V`, each inner list `G[i]` contains unique neighbors of `V[i]`, and these neighbors are sorted according to their appearance order in `V`.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, List, Tuple\n\ndef build_adj_list(V: List[Any], E: List[Tuple[Any, Any]]) -> List[List[Any]]:\n    \"\"\"Convert an undirected graph given by (V, E) to an adjacency list.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    V : List[Any]\n        A list of *unique* vertex identifiers.

{"task_id": 267, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "A decision stump is a simple model that makes predictions based on a single feature and a threshold. The learning process involves finding the optimal feature, threshold, and polarity that minimize a weighted classification error.\n\nThe weighted classification error is defined as:\n`err = sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i * I[hat_y_i != y_i]`\nwhere `w_i` are sample weights, `y_i` are true labels (-1 or 1), and `hat_y_i` are predictions.\n\nThe prediction `hat_y_i` for a sample `x_i` using feature `j`, threshold `theta`, and polarity `p` is:\n*   If `p = 1`: `hat_y_i = 1` if `x_{ij} < theta`, else `-1`.\n*   If `p = -1`: `hat_y_i = -1` if `x_{ij} < theta`, else `1`.\nThis can be rewritten: `hat_y_i = p` if `x_{ij} < theta`, and `hat_y_i = -p` if `x_{ij} >= theta`.\n\nThe algorithm iterates through:\n1.  Each feature `j` from `0` to `d-1`.\n2.  For each feature, two polarities `p = 1` and `p = -1`.\n3.  For each feature and polarity, all unique feature values as candidate thresholds `theta`.\n\nTo efficiently find the best threshold for a given feature and polarity, we can sort the samples based on the feature values. Then, we can scan through the sorted values, updating the weighted error incrementally.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  Initialize `min_weighted_error` to infinity and `best_stump` to an empty dictionary (or a default).\n2.  Handle the edge case of `n_samples = 0`. If so, return a default dictionary as specified or appropriate. (Assuming `n_samples >= 1` based on typical ML problem contexts if not specified otherwise).\n3.  For each `feature_index` from `0` to `d-1`:\n    a.  Get the current feature column `X[:, feature_index]`.\n    b.  Create pairs `(feature_value, true_label, weight)` for all samples.\n    c.  Sort these pairs based on `feature_value`. Let the sorted arrays be `sorted_x_col`, `sorted_y`, `sorted_weights`.\n    d.  **For polarity `p = 1`**:\n        i.  Initialize `current_error`. If all samples are predicted as -1 (i.e., `x >= theta` for all, which occurs when `theta` is the smallest feature value `sorted_x_col[0]`), the error is `sum(sorted_weights[k] for k where sorted_y[k] == 1)`.\n        ii. If this `current_error` is less than `min_weighted_error`, update `min_weighted_error` and `best_stump` with `feature_index`, `threshold = sorted_x_col[0]`, `polarity = 1`, and `current_error`.\n        iii. Iterate `k` from `0` to `n_samples - 2`. In each step, the `k`-th sample (in sorted order) effectively moves from the \"greater or equal\" side (predicted -1) to the \"less than\" side (predicted 1).\n            *   Update `current_error`: If `sorted_y[k] == 1`, this sample was misclassified (contributing `sorted_weights[k]` to error) and is now correctly classified (contributing 0). Error decreases by `sorted_weights[k]`.\n            *   If `sorted_y[k] == -1`, this sample was correctly classified (contributing 0) and is now misclassified (contributing `sorted_weights[k]`). Error increases by `sorted_weights[k]`.\n            *   This update is `current_error = current_error - sorted_y[k] * sorted_weights[k]`.\n            *   The threshold for this new configuration is `sorted_x_col[k+1]`.\n            *   If `sorted_x_col[k] != sorted_x_col[k+1]` (to consider only distinct threshold values): If the new `current_error` is less than `min_weighted_error`, update `min_weighted_error` and `best_stump`.\n    e.  **For polarity `p = -1`**:\n        i.  Initialize `current_error`. If all samples are predicted as 1 (i.e., `x >= theta` for all, `theta = sorted_x_col[0]`), the error is `sum(sorted_weights[k] for k where sorted_y[k] == -1)`.\n        ii. If this `current_error` is less than `min_weighted_error`, update.\n        iii. Iterate `k` from `0` to `n_samples - 2`. The `k`-th sample moves from \"greater or equal\" (predicted 1) to \"less than\" (predicted -1).\n            *   Update `current_error`: If `sorted_y[k] == 1`, error increases by `sorted_weights[k]`.\n            *   If `sorted_y[k] == -1`, error decreases by `sorted_weights[k]`.\n            *   This update is `current_error = current_error + sorted_y[k] * sorted_weights[k]`.\n            *   If `sorted_x_col[k] != sorted_x_col[k+1]`: If new `current_error` is less than `min_weighted_error`, update.\n4.  After checking all features, polarities, and thresholds, `best_stump` will hold the parameters of the optimal stump.\n5.  Round the \"threshold\" and \"weighted_error\" in `best_stump` to 4 decimal places.\n6.  Return `best_stump`.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of `O(d * (n log n + n)) = O(d * n log n)` due to sorting for each feature.\n\nA note on `n_samples = 0`: The problem description implies `X` is a data matrix, usually meaning `n >= 1`. If `n=0` is possible, the behavior should be specified. The solution below handles `n=0` by returning a default dictionary, assuming `n_features >= 1` for `feature_index=0` to be valid.

{"task_id": 273, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To find the optimal numerical threshold for splitting a dataset based on a single feature, we need to evaluate candidate thresholds and select the one that maximizes information gain. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1.  **Helper Function for Shannon Entropy**:\n    First, we need a function to calculate the Shannon entropy `H(S)` for a given set of class labels `S`. The formula is `H(S) = - sum(p_i * log2(p_i))` for each class `i` in `S`, where `p_i` is the proportion of samples belonging to class `i`.\n    *   Input: A list/array of class labels.\n    *   Output: Shannon entropy value (float).\n    *   It should handle empty lists (entropy 0) and lists where all labels are the same (entropy 0).\n    *   `collections.Counter` is useful for getting class counts.\n    *   Care must be taken with `log2(0)`; `p_i * log2(p_i)` is 0 if `p_i` is 0.\n\n2.  **Preprocessing and Initial Checks**:\n    *   Get the total number of samples, `n`. If `n < 2`, no split is possible, so return `(None, 0.0)`.\n    *   Combine the `feature` values and `target` labels into pairs. It's beneficial to convert feature values to `float` at this stage for consistent arithmetic, e.g., using `map(float, feature)`.\n    *   Sort these pairs based on the feature values. This allows efficient iteration through potential split points. Store the sorted feature values and corresponding sorted target labels separately.\n    *   Calculate the entropy of the parent node, `H_parent = H(all_target_labels)`. If `H_parent == 0.0` (i.e., all target labels are the same), no split can improve this, so return `(None, 0.0)`.\n\n3.  **Generating and Evaluating Candidate Thresholds**:\n    *   Initialize `max_ig = 0.0` (since information gain must be positive) and `best_threshold = None`.\n    *   Iterate from `i = 0` to `n-2` through the sorted features:\n        *   A candidate threshold `t` is defined only if `sorted_features[i]` and `sorted_features[i+1]` are distinct.\n        *   If `sorted_features[i] < sorted_features[i+1]`, the candidate threshold is `t = (sorted_features[i] + sorted_features[i+1]) / 2.0`.\n        *   For this threshold `t`, the data is split:\n            *   `Left` subset: Samples corresponding to `sorted_targets[0...i]`.\n            *   `Right` subset: Samples corresponding to `sorted_targets[i+1...n-1]`.\n            *   Let `n_L` and `n_R` be the sizes of these subsets.\n        *   Calculate entropies `H_L = H(Left_targets)` and `H_R = H(Right_targets)`.\n        *   Calculate the information gain: `IG(t) = H_parent - (n_L/n) * H_L - (n_R/n) * H_R`.\n        *   Compare `IG(t)` with `max_ig`:\n            *   If `IG(t) > max_ig`, update `max_ig = IG(t)` and `best_threshold = t`.\n            *   Since candidate thresholds are generated from sorted feature values, they are naturally processed in increasing order. If `IG(t) == max_ig`, the current `best_threshold` (which was found earlier and is smaller) is kept. This satisfies the requirement to return the smallest threshold in case of ties.\n\n4.  **Final Output**:\n    *   After checking all potential thresholds, if `best_threshold` is still `None` (e.g., all feature values were identical) or if `max_ig <= 0.0` (no positive gain was found), return `(None, 0.0)`.\n    *   Otherwise, return `(round(best_threshold, 4), round(max_ig, 4))`.\n\nThis process ensures all distinct midpoints are considered, information gain is calculated correctly, and tie-breaking/edge case rules are followed.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n# import numpy as np # Not strictly needed for this implementation logic\n\ndef best_split(feature, target):\n    \"\"\"Determine the numerical threshold that produces the highest information gain.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    feature : list[int | float] | 1-D numpy.ndarray\n        Numerical values of a single attribute.\n    target  : list[int] | 1-D numpy.ndarray\n        Corresponding class labels.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple\n        (threshold, information_gain) where\n        * threshold \u2013 float rounded to 4 decimals or None when no useful split exists;\n        * information_gain \u2013 float rounded to 4 decimals.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Nested helper function for Shannon entropy\n    def _calculate_entropy(labels):\n        if not labels: # Handles empty list\n            return 0.0\n        \n        n_labels = len(labels)\n        # n_labels will be > 0 here due to the check above.\n        # if n_labels == 1, counts will have one item, p_i = 1.0, log2(1.0)=0, entropy=0.

{"task_id": 294, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To convert the custom graph representation `G` into a plain adjacency dictionary `adj`, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Handle Empty Graph**: If the input graph `G` has no vertices (i.e., `G['_V2I']` is empty or not present), an empty dictionary should be returned.\n\n2.  **Initialize Adjacency Dictionary**: Create an empty dictionary `adj`. Then, populate it with all vertex labels found in `G['_V2I']`. Each label will be a key in `adj`, and its initial value will be an empty list. This ensures that all vertices, including isolated ones (those without incident edges), are present in the final output.\n\n3.  **Process Edges**:\n    *   Retrieve the `is_directed` flag from `G`.\n    *   Iterate through `G['_G']`. `G['_G']` is a list of lists, where each inner list `G['_G'][i]` contains outgoing edge tuples `(source_label, target_label, weight)` for the vertex corresponding to index `i`.\n    *   For each edge tuple `(u, v, w)` found:\n        *   Add the directed edge `u \\rightarrow v` with weight `w` to our `adj` structure. This means appending the tuple `(v, float(w))` to the list `adj[u]`. We explicitly convert `w` to `float` to match the output type specification.\n        *   If the graph is undirected (`is_directed` is `False`), the edge also implies `v \\rightarrow u` with the same weight `w`. So, append `(u, float(w))` to `adj[v]`.\n\n4.  **Finalize Neighbor Lists**: After processing all edges from `G['_G']`:\n    *   Iterate through each vertex `label` in `adj`.\n    *   **Remove Duplicates**: The list `adj[label]` might contain duplicate neighbor entries. This can happen if `G['_G']` itself had duplicate edges, or for undirected graphs where an edge `{u,v}` might have been processed from `u`'s list and `v`'s list in `G['_G']`, leading to multiple additions. To ensure each edge appears \"exactly once in each direction\" for undirected graphs (and to clean up potential duplicates in directed graphs), convert `adj[label]` to a `set` of `(neighbor, weight)` tuples, and then back to a `list`. This removes duplicates.\n    *   **Sort Neighbors**: Sort this list of unique `(neighbor, weight)` tuples. The sorting must be \"alphabetically\" (lexicographically) based on the neighbor's label (the first element of the tuple).\n\n5.  **Return `adj`**: The resulting `adj` dictionary is the desired output.\n\nThis process ensures all requirements are met: all vertices are included, edge directions are handled correctly for directed and undirected graphs (with the \"exactly once in each direction\" rule for undirected), neighbor lists are sorted, and isolated vertices are correctly represented.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple\n\ndef to_networkx(G: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[Any, List[Tuple[Any, float]]]:\n    \"\"\"Convert a custom graph dictionary into a plain adjacency dictionary.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    G : dict\n        A graph represented as a dictionary with the keys:\n          * 'is_directed' (bool)\n          * '_V2I'        (dict mapping vertex label -> index)\n          * '_G'          (list of adjacency lists, each edge is a\n                           tuple (source_label, target_label, weight))\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    dict\n        A dictionary where each key is a vertex label and the value is a list\n        of `(neighbour, weight)` tuples.

{"task_id": 302, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement Spectral Clustering from scratch, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Build the Adjacency Matrix (W)**:\n    The weight `w_ij` between two points `x_i` and `x_j` is defined as `1 / (1 + ||x_i - x_j||_2)`. The Euclidean norm `||x_i - x_j||_2` represents the distance between the points. The diagonal elements `w_ii` must be 0, as a point is not connected to itself.\n    We can compute all pairwise squared Euclidean distances efficiently. For a data matrix `X` of shape `(n, d)`:\n    Let `R_i = sum_p (X[i,p]^2)`.\n    The squared distance `dist_sq_ij = ||x_i - x_j||_2^2 = R_i - 2 * (X @ X.T)_ij + R_j`.\n    Then, `norms_ij = sqrt(dist_sq_ij)`.\n    `W_ij = 1 / (1 + norms_ij)`. Finally, set diagonal of `W` to 0.\n\n2.  **Compute the Graph Laplacian (L)**:\n    The unnormalized graph Laplacian `L` is computed as `L = D - W`.\n    `D` is the degree matrix, which is a diagonal matrix where `D_ii = sum_j w_ij` (the sum of weights of edges connected to node `i`).\n\n3.  **Eigen Decomposition of L**:\n    We find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of `L`. Since `L` is symmetric and positive semi-definite, we use `np.linalg.eigh`. This function conveniently returns eigenvalues in ascending order.\n    We select the first `k` eigenvectors (corresponding to the `k` smallest eigenvalues) and stack them column-wise to form the matrix `E` of shape `(n, k)`. Each row of `E` can be seen as a new k-dimensional representation of the original data points.\n\n4.  **K-means Clustering on E**:\n    We apply k-means clustering to the `n` rows of `E`.\n    *   **Initialization**: The initial centroids are the first `k` rows of `E`.\n    *   **Distance Metric**: Euclidean distance is used.\n    *   **Iteration**: K-means iterates by assigning each point to the nearest centroid and then recalculating centroids as the mean of points in each cluster. This continues until cluster assignments no longer change or a maximum of 100 iterations is reached.\n    *   **Empty Clusters**: If a cluster becomes empty (no points assigned to it), its centroid is re-initialized using a randomly selected row from `E`.\n\n5.  **Return Labels**:\n    The final cluster assignments from k-means are returned as a Python list of integers, where each integer is in the range `[0, k-1]`.\n\nThe implementation assumes `k >= 1` and `k <= n_samples` (number of data points) due to the k-means initialization strategy specified (\"first k rows of E\").\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef spectral_clustering(X: np.ndarray, k: int) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Cluster data using Spectral Clustering.\n\n    Args:\n        X: 2-D NumPy array where each row is a data sample.\n        k: Desired number of clusters.\n\n    Returns:\n        List of length n_samples containing an integer cluster label for each sample.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_samples, _ = X.shape\n\n    if n_samples == 0:\n        return []\n\n    # It's implied that k is a positive integer, typically >= 1.\n    # The problem constraints (labels in [0, k-1]) also imply k >= 1.\n    # The k-means initialization (first k rows of E) implies k <= n_samples.\n    # We assume valid k based on these implicit problem constraints.\n    if k <= 0:\n        # This case is ill-defined for clustering and k-means as specified.\n        # Depending on requirements, could raise ValueError or return default.\n        # For this problem, assume k >= 1.

The model assumes a normal-inverse-gamma conjugate prior on the coefficients **b** and the noise variance \u03c3\u00b2. The key insight is that the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate of **b**, which in this case is also its posterior mean, does not depend on the unknown \u03c3\u00b2 because it cancels out in the derivation.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  **Preprocessing**:\n    *   If `fit_intercept` is `True`, prepend a column of ones to the design matrix `X`. This updates the number of features, `M_features`.\n    *   If `M_features` is 0 (e.g., `X` has no columns and no intercept is fitted), return an empty list.\n    *   Process the prior mean `mu`: If `mu` is a scalar, broadcast it to a vector of length `M_features`. If `mu` is array-like, ensure it has `M_features` elements or can be broadcast from a single element.\n    *   Process the prior scale hyperparameter `V` to construct `V_inv_prior_scale_matrix`.

These are the corner frequencies that define the triangular filters. Each filter `i` is defined by three consecutive corner frequencies: `hz_corner_freqs[i]`, `hz_corner_freqs[i+1]` (peak), and `hz_corner_freqs[i+2]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate DFT Bin Frequencies**:\n    *   The power spectrum `P` has length `N // 2 + 1`.\n    *   The center frequency for each DFT bin `k` is `k * fs / N`.\n\n4.  **Compute Filter Weights**:\n    *   Initialize an empty filterbank matrix of shape `(n_filters, N // 2 + 1)`.\n    *   For each filter `m` and each DFT bin frequency `f_k`:\n        *   Let the m-th filter's corner frequencies be `f_left = hz_corner_freqs[m]`, `f_center = hz_corner_freqs[m+1]`, and `f_right = hz_corner_freqs[m+2]`.\n        *   The left-hand slope contribution is `(f_k - f_left) / (f_center - f_left)`.\n        *   The right-hand slope contribution is `(f_right - f_k) / (f_right - f_center)`.\n        *   The weight is the positive minimum of these two slope values: `max(0.0, min(left_slope_value, right_slope_value))`.\n        *   Special care is taken for cases where slope denominators are zero (i.e., zero-width segments of a triangle).

Since external scientific libraries like SciPy are not allowed for the digamma function itself, we need to implement it.\n\nThe digamma function \u03c8(x) will be implemented using two strategies as suggested:\n1.  **Recursion for small x**: For `x < THRESHOLD` (e.g., `THRESHOLD = 6`), we use the recurrence relation \u03c8(x) = \u03c8(x+1) \u2212 1/x. This can be rewritten as \u03c8(x) = \u03c8(x+n) \u2212 \u2211\u1d62<0 to n-1> 1/(x+i). We apply this to increase `x` until it is greater than or equal to `THRESHOLD`.\n2.  **Asymptotic expansion for larger x**: Once `x >= THRESHOLD`, we use the asymptotic expansion:\n    \u03c8(x) \u2248 ln x \u2212 1/(2x) \u2212 1/(12x\u00b2) + 1/(120x\u2074) \u2212 1/(252x\u2076).\n\nThe main function `expected_log_dirichlet(gamma, d, t)` will then:\n1.  Take `gamma` (a 2D list or NumPy array), row index `d`, and column index `t` as input.\n2.  Ensure `gamma` is treated as a NumPy array of floats for convenient element access and summation.\n3.  Extract the specific parameter `gamma_dt = gamma[d,t]`.\n4.  Calculate the sum of parameters for the d-th sample: `sum_gamma_d_k = \u2211\u2096 \u03b3[d,k]`.\n5.  Compute `\u03c8(gamma_dt)` and `\u03c8(sum_gamma_d_k)` using our custom `_digamma` function.\n6.  Calculate the difference: `\u03c8(gamma_dt) - \u03c8(sum_gamma_d_k)`.\n7.

{"task_id": 318, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement AdaBoost.M1 from scratch with decision stumps, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Decision Stump (Weak Learner)**:\n    *   A decision stump is a one-level decision tree. It splits data based on a single feature `j`, a threshold `t`, and a polarity `p`.\n    *   The prediction rule is `h(x) = p * sign(x_j - t)`.\n    *   The `sign(z)` function is defined as `-1` if `z < 0` and `+1` otherwise (so `sign(0) = +1`).\n    *   To find the best stump in each AdaBoost iteration, we need to search through all features, all possible thresholds for each feature, and both polarities (`p=1` and `p=-1`).\n    *   The \"best\" stump is the one that minimizes the weighted classification error `epsilon_m` on the training data, where weights are updated in each AdaBoost round.\n    *   An efficient way to find the best threshold for a given feature and polarity involves sorting the feature values and then iterating through them once, updating the weighted error incrementally. This takes `O(N log N)` for sorting plus `O(N)` for scanning, where `N` is the number of samples. This is done for each feature.\n\n2.  **AdaBoost.M1 Algorithm**:\n    *   Initialize sample weights `w_i = 1/N` for all `N` training samples.\n    *   For `m` from 1 to `M` (number of estimators/boosting rounds):\n        a.  Train a decision stump `h_m(x)` by finding the one that minimizes the weighted error `epsilon_m = sum(w_i * I(y_i != h_m(x_i))) / sum(w_i)`. Since weights are normalized (`sum(w_i)=1`), `epsilon_m = sum(w_i * I(y_i != h_m(x_i)))`.\n        b.  Calculate the stump's weight (importance) `alpha_m = 0.5 * ln((1 - epsilon_m) / epsilon_m)`. To prevent division by zero or `log(0)` if `epsilon_m` is 0 or 1, a small constant `1e-10` is added to the numerator and denominator terms involving `epsilon_m`.\n        c.  Store `h_m` and `alpha_m`.\n        d.  Update sample weights: `w_i = w_i * exp(-alpha_m * y_i * h_m(x_i))`.\n        e.  Normalize weights: `w_i = w_i / sum(w_j)`. If `sum(w_j)` becomes zero (e.g., if a perfect stump makes `alpha_m` infinite and all weights zero), and more estimators are required, reinitialize weights to `1/N` to continue.\n    *   The loop runs for exactly `n_estimators` rounds.\n\n3.  **Prediction**:\n    *   The final boosted classifier's prediction for a sample `x` is `F(x) = sign(sum_{m=1 to M} alpha_m * h_m(x))`.\n    *   Again, `sign(0)` is taken as `+1`.\n\nThe implementation will use `numpy` for numerical operations and `math` if needed (though `numpy` often provides equivalent functions). No other machine learning libraries are used.\n\nThe solution will be structured with:\n*   A `DecisionStump` class to encapsulate stump logic (fitting is implicitly done by searching in the main loop, but prediction is a clear method).\n*   A helper function `_find_best_stump` to find the optimal stump given current sample weights.\n*   The main `adaboost_predict` function orchestrating the training and prediction.\n\nEdge cases like empty training/test sets or data with no features are handled by returning default predictions.

The behavior of the function depends on the `positive_only` flag.\n\nFirst, we handle the input validation: if `N` or `fs` is not strictly positive, an empty list is returned as per the requirements.\n\n**If `positive_only` is `True`:**\nWe need to return the non-negative frequencies. These correspond to bin indices `k = 0, 1, ..., floor(N/2)`.\nThe number of such bins is `floor(N/2) + 1`.\nWe can generate an array of these `k` values using `np.arange(N // 2 + 1)`.\nThen, we multiply these `k` values by the frequency resolution `delta_f = fs / N` to get the frequencies.\n\n**If `positive_only` is `False`:**\nWe need to return all `N` bin centre frequencies, arranged in the same order as NumPy's `np.fft.fftfreq` function.\nThe `np.fft.fftfreq(N, d)` function computes the DFT sample frequencies. The parameter `d` is the sample spacing, which is `1 / fs`.\nSo, `np.fft.fftfreq(N, d=1.0/fs)` directly provides the required frequencies in Hertz, ordered as specified: `[0, 1\u00b7\u0394f, \u2026, (\u2308N/2\u2309\u22121)\u00b7\u0394f, \u2212\u230aN/2\u230b\u00b7\u0394f, \u2026, \u2212\u0394f]`, where `\u0394f = fs / N`.\n\n**Rounding and Output Format:**\nAfter computing the frequencies (either for the positive-only case or the full spectrum case), all numbers must be rounded to 4 decimal places. NumPy's `np.round(array, decimals=4)` function is suitable for this.\nFinally, the resulting NumPy array of rounded frequencies must be converted to a regular Python list using the `.tolist()` method.\n\nThe implementation uses NumPy for efficient array operations and for the `fftfreq` utility.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef dft_bins(N: int, fs: int = 44000, positive_only: bool = True) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Compute the centre frequency of each DFT bin.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    N : int\n        Number of DFT coefficients.\n    fs : int, optional\n        Sampling frequency in Hertz.

We can use the `oob_mask` to achieve this. A common technique is to create a new array where predictions from in-bag trees are replaced with `NaN` (Not a Number). The `np.where(oob_mask, predictions, np.nan)` function is suitable for this.\n\n4.  **Calculate Average OOB Prediction per Sample**: For each sample, calculate the average of its OOB predictions. `np.nanmean` along the estimators axis (`axis=1`) will compute this average, automatically ignoring the `NaN` values (in-bag predictions). If a sample has no OOB predictions (all its predictions were marked `NaN` in the previous step), `np.nanmean` will result in `NaN` for that sample's average. A `RuntimeWarning` for \"Mean of empty slice\" might occur if a row is all NaNs; this can be suppressed using `np.errstate`.\n\n5.  **Identify Samples with OOB Predictions**: Determine which samples have at least one OOB prediction.

To count support based on \"occurrence in distinct transactions\", we consider each item only once per transaction, even if it appears multiple times within that transaction.

We'll store these frequent items and their supports in a dictionary, say `frequent_items_with_support`.\n\n3.  **Establish Global Ordering**:\n    *   The frequent items need a global order for constructing paths in the FP-Tree.

{"task_id": 336, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the `linear_kernel` function, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Input Conversion and Validation (X)**:\n    *   Convert the input `X` into a NumPy array with `dtype=float`. `np.asarray` is used for efficiency as it avoids copying data if `X` is already a NumPy array of the correct type.\n    *   A `ValueError` during this conversion (e.g., if `X` is a ragged list like `[[1],[1,2]]`) indicates a malformed input, so we return -1.\n    *   Validate the dimensionality of `X_np`:\n        *   If `X_np` is 1D:\n            *   If its shape is `(0,)` (i.e., `X` was `[]` or `np.array([])`), this means `N=0`. According to Rule 2, return an empty list `[]`.\n            *   Otherwise (e.g., `X` was `[1,2,3]`), it's not a collection of vectors (N,C). Return -1.\n        *   If `X_np` is not 2D (e.g., scalar, 3D or higher), it's an invalid shape. Return -1.\n    *   At this point, `X_np` must be a 2D array. If its first dimension `N` (number of rows) is 0 (e.g., `X` was `np.empty((0,C))`), Rule 2 applies: return `[]`.\n    *   Store `N = X_np.shape[0]` and `C_X = X_np.shape[1]`.\n\n2.  **Input Conversion and Validation (Y)**:\n    *   If `Y` is `None`, set `Y_np = X_np`. The number of vectors `M` will be `N`, and columns `C_Y` will be `C_X`.\n    *   If `Y` is provided:\n        *   Convert `Y` to `Y_np_orig` (NumPy array, `dtype=float`), similar to `X`. Return -1 if malformed.\n        *   Validate dimensionality of `Y_np_orig`:\n            *   If 1D and shape `(0,)` (`Y` was `[]` or `np.array([])`): This means `M=0`. For consistent matrix operations, create `Y_np` as an empty array with `C_X` columns: `np.empty((0, C_X), dtype=float)`. The column compatibility is implicitly handled by forming an (N,0) kernel matrix.\n            *   If 1D and non-empty: Invalid shape for `Y`. Return -1.\n            *   If 2D: Let `Y_np = Y_np_orig`. Check Rule 1: if `Y_np.shape[1]` (i.e., `C_Y`) is not equal to `C_X`, return -1. This check covers cases where `M=0` (e.g., `Y` was `np.empty((0, C_Y_val))`) and `C_Y_val != C_X`.\n            *   If not 1D or 2D: Invalid shape for `Y`. Return -1.\n\n3.  **Kernel Computation**:\n    *   Ensure `c0` is a float: `c0_float = float(c0)`.\n    *   The linear kernel `k(x,y) = x\u00b7y + c0` can be computed for all pairs using matrix multiplication: `K = X_np @ Y_np.T + c0_float`.\n        *   `X_np` has shape (N, `C_X`).\n        *   `Y_np` (after processing) has shape (M, `C_X`).\n        *   `Y_np.T` (transpose of `Y_np`) has shape (`C_X`, M).\n        *   `X_np @ Y_np.T` results in an (N, M) matrix of dot products.\n        *   Adding `c0_float` broadcasts the constant to all elements.\n        *   This handles edge cases like `N=0` (already returned `[]`), `M=0` (results in an (N,0) matrix), or `C_X=0` (results in an (N,M) matrix of `c0_float`).\n\n4.  **Rounding and Output Format**:\n    *   Round all elements of the resulting kernel matrix to 4 decimal places using `np.round(kernel_matrix_np, 4)`. `np.round` uses \"round half to even\" for tie-breaking (e.g., 2.5 rounds to 2, 3.5 rounds to 4), which is consistent with Python 3's built-in `round()` function.\n    *   Convert the rounded NumPy matrix to a list of lists of floats using its `.tolist()` method. This method correctly handles empty matrices (e.g., an (N,0) matrix becomes a list of N empty lists).\n\nThis approach ensures all numerical operations use floating-point precision, handles various input types and shapes including empty inputs, validates dimensions, and produces the output in the specified format.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Union # For type hints\n\ndef linear_kernel(X: Union[List[List[Union[int, float]]], \"np.ndarray\"], \n                  Y: Union[List[List[Union[int, float]]], \"np.ndarray\", None] = None, \n                  c0: Union[int, float] = 0) -> Union[List[List[float]], int]:\n    \"\"\"Return the linear kernel matrix k(x, y) = x\u00b7y + c0.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X : 2-D list or NumPy array with shape (N, C)\n        Collection of N input vectors.\n    Y : 2-D list or NumPy array with shape (M, C) or None, optional\n        Collection of M input vectors.

{"task_id": 340, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement a single optimization step of the Adam algorithm, we will follow the standard update rules provided. The function needs to handle multi-dimensional parameters using NumPy for vectorized operations. Special attention is given to the case where the gradient is exactly zero, ensuring the parameter remains unchanged while moment estimates are still updated. The final results (updated parameter, new first moment, and new second moment) must be returned as Python lists, with all numerical values rounded to 8 decimal places.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps involved in the `adam_update` function:\n\n1.  **Update Biased Moment Estimates**:\n    *   The first moment estimate `m\u209c` (mean of gradients) is updated using `m\u209c = \u03b2\u2081\u22c5m + (1\u2212\u03b2\u2081)\u22c5g`.\n    *   The second moment estimate `v\u209c` (uncentered variance of gradients) is updated using `v\u209c = \u03b2\u2082\u22c5v + (1\u2212\u03b2\u2082)\u22c5g\u00b2`.\n    These updates are performed element-wise for NumPy arrays `m`, `v`, and `g`.\n\n2.  **Handle Zero Gradient Case for Parameter Update**:\n    *   The problem specifies that if the gradient `g` is exactly zero (all its elements are zero), the parameter `\u03b8` must remain unchanged. The moment estimates `m\u209c` and `v\u209c` should still be updated as per Step 1.\n    *   If `np.all(grad == 0)` is true, `\u03b8\u2032` is simply a copy of `\u03b8`.\n\n3.  **Compute Bias-Corrected Moment Estimates (if gradient is non-zero)**:\n    *   If the gradient is not all zeros, we proceed to compute bias-corrected estimates.\n    *   `m\u0302\u209c = m\u209c / (1\u2212\u03b2\u2081\u1d57)`\n    *   `v\u0302\u209c = v\u209c / (1\u2212\u03b2\u2082\u1d57)`\n    Here, `t` is the time-step (starting from 1). The terms `(1\u2212\u03b2\u2081\u1d57)` and `(1\u2212\u03b2\u2082\u1d57)` correct for the initialization of `m` and `v` (usually as zeros) at the beginning of training. We assume `0 < \u03b2\u2081, \u03b2\u2082 < 1` and `t \u2265 1`, so the denominators are non-zero.\n\n4.  **Update Parameter (if gradient is non-zero)**:\n    *   The parameter `\u03b8` is updated using `\u03b8\u2032 = \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b1 \u00b7 m\u0302\u209c / (\u221av\u0302\u209c + \u03b5)`.\n    *   `\u03b1` is the learning rate (`lr`).\n    *   `\u03b5` (`eps`) is a small constant to prevent division by zero when `v\u0302\u209c` is very small.\n    *   `np.sqrt(v\u0302\u209c)` is the element-wise square root.\n\n5.  **Format Output**:\n    *   The updated parameter `\u03b8\u2032`, the new first moment `m\u209c`, and the new second moment `v\u209c` must be returned.\n    *   These NumPy arrays are first rounded to 8 decimal places.\n    *   Then, they are converted to Python lists. A helper function `_to_rounded_list` is used to ensure that even 0-dimensional (scalar) arrays are converted to lists (e.g., `np.array(0.5)` becomes `[0.5]`) to strictly adhere to the `tuple[list, list, list]` return type hint. For N-D arrays (N >= 1), `np.ndarray.tolist()` naturally produces lists or nested lists.\n\nThe implementation uses NumPy's vectorized operations for efficiency across different array shapes.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpy as np # As per \"Your code should start with\"\n\ndef adam_update(\n    param: np.ndarray,\n    grad: np.ndarray,\n    t: int,\n    m: np.ndarray,\n    v: np.ndarray,\n    lr: float = 0.001,\n    beta1: float = 0.9,\n    beta2: float = 0.999,\n    eps: float = 1e-8,\n) -> tuple[list, list, list]:\n    \"\"\"Perform **one** Adam optimisation step.\n\n    Args:\n        param: Current value of the parameter \u03b8 (NumPy array).\n        grad:  Current gradient \u2207\u03b8 (same shape as *param*).\n        t:     Time-step counter **starting at 1**.\n        m:     First moment estimate from the previous step (same shape).\n        v:     Second moment estimate from the previous step (same shape).\n        lr:    Learning rate \u03b1 (default 0.001).\n        beta1: Exponential decay rate for the first moment (default 0.9).\n        beta2: Exponential decay rate for the second moment (default 0.999).\n        eps:   Small constant to avoid division by zero (default 1e-8).\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple containing (updated_parameter, new_moment, new_variance) **as\n        python lists**, each rounded to 8 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Local helper function for output formatting.\n    # Ensures that the returned elements are Python lists, even for 0-D (scalar) inputs,\n    # and that all numerical values are rounded to 8 decimal places.\n    def _to_rounded_list(arr: np.ndarray) -> list:\n        # Round all elements in the array to 8 decimal places\n        rounded_arr = np.round(arr, 8)\n        # Convert to list.

{"task_id": 353, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To calculate the Shannon entropy of a sequence of class labels, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Count Frequencies**: First, we need to determine the frequency of each unique label in the input sequence. The `collections.Counter` class is well-suited for this task, as it can handle various iterable inputs (lists, NumPy arrays, etc.) containing hashable items.\n2.  **Calculate Total Labels**: The total number of labels (`n_labels`) is the sum of these frequencies. This will be used as the denominator for calculating probabilities.\n3.  **Handle Special Cases**:\n    *   **Empty Input**: If `n_labels` is 0 (i.e., the input sequence is empty), the entropy is defined as 0.0.\n    *   **All Labels Identical**: If all labels in the sequence are the same, there is no impurity. This means there is only one unique label type in the `counts`. In this case, the entropy is also 0.0.\n4.  **Calculate Probabilities**: For each unique label \\(i\\), its probability \\(p_i\\) is calculated as \\(\\text{count}_i / n_{\\text{labels}}\\).\n5.  **Sum Contributions to Entropy**: The Shannon entropy \\(H\\) is given by the formula \\(H = -\\sum_i p_i \\log_2 p_i\\). We iterate through the counts of unique labels. For each label:\n    *   Calculate its probability \\(p_i\\).\n    *   Calculate the term \\(p_i \\log_2 p_i\\). The `math.log2()` function is used for the base-2 logarithm.\n    *   Sum these terms. The formula includes a negative sign for the sum.\n    *   The convention that \\(0 \\log 0 = 0\\) is naturally handled because labels that do not occur (count = 0, so \\(p_i = 0\\)) will not be in the `counts.values()` obtained from `Counter` (or their count would be 0, leading to a zero term if they were explicitly considered). Since `Counter` only stores items with counts \\(\\ge 1\\), \\(p_i\\) in our loop will always be greater than 0, so \\(\\log_2 p_i\\) is always well-defined.\n6.  **Round Result**: The final entropy value is rounded to 5 decimal places as required.\n\nThe `numpy` import is included as per the problem's template, although the `collections.Counter`-based solution does not directly call NumPy functions. `Counter` itself can efficiently process NumPy arrays by iterating over their elements.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport numpy as np # Included as per the problem's template.\n\ndef entropy(labels) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute the base-2 Shannon entropy of a 1-D sequence of class labels.\n\n    Args:\n        labels: A one-dimensional iterable (list, NumPy array, etc.) of hashable\n            class labels.\n\n    Returns:\n        The entropy value rounded to five decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Count frequencies of each label.\n    # collections.Counter handles various iterables (lists, NumPy arrays, etc.)\n    # and requires hashable items, fitting the problem description.\n    counts = Counter(labels)\n\n    # Calculate the total number of labels from the sum of frequencies.\n    # If 'labels' was empty, 'counts' will be empty, and n_labels will be 0.\n    n_labels = sum(counts.values())\n\n    # Special case 1: Empty input.\n    # If n_labels is 0, the input sequence is empty, and entropy is 0.0.\n    if n_labels == 0:\n        return 0.0\n\n    # Special case 2: All labels are identical.\n    # This occurs if there's only one unique label type in 'counts'.\n    # (n_labels > 0 is true at this point if len(counts) == 1).\n    # In this case, entropy is 0.0.\n    if len(counts) == 1:\n        return 0.0\n\n    # Calculate Shannon entropy.\n    # H = -sum(p_i * log2(p_i) for each unique label i)\n    entropy_val = 0.0\n    for count in counts.values():\n        # p_i is the probability of the current label.\n        p_i = count / n_labels\n        \n        # Add the term for this label to the entropy sum.\n        # Since 'count' from Counter.values() is always > 0, p_i > 0,\n        # so math.log2(p_i) is well-defined.\n        entropy_val -= p_i * math.log2(p_i)\n\n    # Round the final entropy value to 5 decimal places.\n    return round(entropy_val, 5)\n\n```"}

Note that `in_ch` from `X` must match `W_in_ch` from `W`.\n    *   Determine the dilation rate: `d_rate = dilation + 1`. This `d_rate` is the step size used when sampling input pixels for a dilated kernel.\n    *   Calculate the effective kernel size, which is the spatial extent of the kernel in the input image when dilation is applied:\n        *   `eff_kernel_rows = (kernel_rows - 1) * d_rate + 1`\n        *   `eff_kernel_cols = (kernel_cols - 1) * d_rate + 1`\n\n2.  **Padding Calculation**:\n    *   The `pad` argument is parsed to determine `pr1, pr2, pc1, pc2` (padding for top, bottom, left, right respectively).\n        *   Integer `p`: `pr1 = pr2 = pc1 = pc2 = p`.\n        *   2-tuple `(pr, pc)`: `pr1 = pr2 = pr`, `pc1 = pc2 = pc`.\n        *   4-tuple `(pt, pb, pl, pr)`: `pr1=pt, pr2=pb, pc1=pl, pc2=pr`.\n        *   String `'same'`: The goal is to make the output spatial dimensions (`out_rows`, `out_cols`) identical to the input spatial dimensions (`in_rows`, `in_cols`).\n            The formula for output dimension is `out_dim = (in_dim_padded - eff_kernel_dim) / stride + 1`.\n            Setting `out_dim = in_dim`, we solve for `in_dim_padded`: `in_dim_padded = (in_dim - 1) * stride + eff_kernel_dim`.\n            The total padding needed is `total_pad_dim = in_dim_padded - in_dim`.\n            So, `total_pad_rows = (in_rows - 1) * stride + eff_kernel_rows - in_rows`.\n            And `total_pad_cols = (in_cols - 1) * stride + eff_kernel_cols - in_cols`.\n            \"Smallest symmetric padding\" implies non-negative padding. If `total_pad_dim` calculates to a negative value (meaning the target output size would be achieved with input cropping, or the output would be larger than input even with zero padding), we use `0` padding. So, `total_pad_dim = max(0, total_pad_dim)`.\n            This total padding is distributed symmetrically: `p1 = total_pad_dim // 2`, `p2 = total_pad_dim - p1`.\n\n3.  **Apply Padding**:\n    *   Zero-padding is applied to `X` using `np.pad` according to `pr1, pr2, pc1, pc2`, resulting in `X_padded`.\n    *   The new dimensions `padded_in_rows` and `padded_in_cols` are noted.\n\n4.  **Calculate Output Dimensions**:\n    *   `out_rows = (padded_in_rows - eff_kernel_rows) // stride + 1`\n    *   `out_cols = (padded_in_cols - eff_kernel_cols) // stride + 1`\n    *   To prevent negative dimensions (which can occur if `padded_dim < eff_kernel_dim`), `out_rows = max(0, out_rows)` and `out_cols = max(0, out_cols)`. If either is zero, the output for that dimension will be empty, which NumPy handles correctly.\n\n5.  **`im2col` Transformation**:\n    *   This step rearranges image patches from `X_padded` into columns of a matrix.

{"task_id": 357, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the K-Means clustering algorithm, we will follow the specified procedure:\n\n1.  **Handle K=1 Special Case**: If `K` is 1, the single centroid is computed as the mean of all data points. Its coordinates are rounded to four decimals, and it's returned as a list containing one list (the centroid).\n\n2.  **Initialization (for K > 1)**:\n    *   The first `K` samples from the `data` array are chosen as the initial `K` centroids.\n    *   These centroids are stored as a NumPy array of floats (e.g., `np.float64`) to ensure precision during mean calculations and to create a distinct copy from the input data.\n    *   A check is added to ensure `K` is not greater than the number of samples, as this initialization method would otherwise fail.\n\n3.  **Iterative Process (for K > 1)**: This process repeats for a maximum of `max_iters` (default 100) times or until convergence.\n    *   **Store Old Centroids**: In each iteration, a copy of the current centroids is saved. These \"old\" centroids are used for assigning samples and for the convergence check at the end of the iteration.\n    *   **Assignment Step**:\n        *   For every data sample, its Euclidean distance to each of the current `K` (old) centroids is calculated.\n        *   Each sample is assigned to the cluster corresponding to the nearest centroid. This results in a `labels` array, where `labels[i]` is the index of the centroid assigned to `data[i]`.\n    *   **Update Step**:\n        *   New centroids are computed for the current iteration. For each cluster `k`:\n            *   If cluster `k` has samples assigned to it, its new centroid is the mean of those samples.\n            *   If cluster `k` is empty (no samples assigned), its centroid remains unchanged from its value at the start of the current iteration (i.e., it keeps the corresponding `old_centroid` value).\n        *   The main `centroids` array is updated with these newly computed values.\n    *   **Convergence Check**:\n        *   The maximum absolute difference between the coordinates of the new centroids and the old centroids is calculated.\n        *   If this maximum change is less than a specified tolerance (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076), the algorithm is considered to have converged, and the iteration loop stops early.\n\n4.  **Final Output Formatting**:\n    *   After the loop terminates (either by convergence or reaching `max_iters`), the final `K` centroids (which are in a NumPy array) are converted to a Python list of lists.\n    *   This list of centroids is sorted lexicographically (e.g., `[[1,2],[0,5]]` becomes `[[0,5],[1,2]]`). Python's default list sort achieves this for lists of lists.\n    *   Finally, each coordinate of every centroid in the sorted list is rounded to four decimal places.\n    *   The resulting list of lists of rounded centroid coordinates is returned.\n\nThe implementation uses NumPy for efficient array operations, particularly for distance calculations and mean computations.

{"task_id": 363, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To determine if an action or observation space is continuous, we need to consider its type and the corresponding boolean flag (`tuple_action` or `tuple_obs`).\n\nThe core logic can be encapsulated in a helper function, say `_is_single_space_continuous`, which takes a space object and its \"is_composite\" flag as input.\n\n1.  **If the `is_composite_flag` is `False`**:\n    The space is continuous if and only if it is an instance of the `Box` class. This is a direct check: `isinstance(space_obj, Box)`.\n\n2.  **If the `is_composite_flag` is `True`**:\n    This indicates that the space is expected to be a composite type (`Tuple` or `Dict`). The rule for continuity in this case is stricter: the space is continuous *only if* it is a `Tuple` or `Dict` **and** *all* of its sub-spaces are instances of `Box`.\n    *   If `space_obj` is an instance of `Tuple`: We iterate through `space_obj.spaces`. If all these sub-spaces are `Box`, the `Tuple` space is continuous. An empty `Tuple` (i.e., `Tuple([])`) is considered continuous because the condition \"all sub-spaces are `Box`\" is vacuously true.\n    *   If `space_obj` is an instance of `Dict`: We iterate through the values of `space_obj.spaces` (i.e., `space_obj.spaces.values()`). If all these sub-spaces are `Box`, the `Dict` space is continuous. An empty `Dict` (i.e., `Dict({})`) is also considered continuous for the same reason.\n    *   If `space_obj` is *not* an instance of `Tuple` or `Dict` (e.g., it's a `Box` or `Discrete`): Even though the `is_composite_flag` is `True`, the space itself doesn't meet the structural requirement of being a `Tuple` or `Dict` whose elements are all `Box`. Therefore, it's considered not continuous under this rule.\n\nThe main `is_continuous` function will then call this helper function twice: once for `env.action_space` with `tuple_action`, and once for `env.observation_space` with `tuple_obs`.

{"task_id": 371, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the 1-D cross-correlation (convolution for deep learning) with support for batches, multiple channels, stride, padding, and dilation, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Input Validation**: Check the shapes and types of input arrays (`X`, `W`) and parameters (`stride`, `pad`, `dilation`). Ensure channel dimensions match and parameters are valid (e.g., positive stride, non-negative dilation).\n2.  **Effective Kernel Width Calculation**: The dilation parameter spreads out the kernel elements. The `effective_kernel_width` is `(kernel_width - 1) * (dilation + 1) + 1`.

The new padded length will be `L_in_padded = L_in + p_left + p_right`.\n5.  **Output Dimensions Calculation**: The output length `L_out` is calculated using the formula:\n    `L_out = floor((L_in_padded - effective_kernel_width) / stride) + 1`.\n    If `L_in_padded < effective_kernel_width`, then `L_out` is 0.\n6.  **Initialization**: Create an output NumPy array `output` of shape `(n_examples, L_out, out_channels)` filled with zeros.\n7.  **Cross-Correlation Computation**: Iterate through each example in the batch, each output channel, and each position in the output signal.

These residuals are the negative gradients of the squared error loss function and will be the target for the decision stump in the current round.\n    *   **Build Decision Stump**:\n        *   Sort the samples based on their feature values `x`. This allows for efficient evaluation of all possible split points.\n        *   Identify candidate split points `t`. A candidate split point is located halfway between any two *different* consecutive sorted `x` values.\n        *   For each candidate split `t`, the stump predicts `r_bar_L` (mean of residuals for samples `x_i <= t`) for the left side and `r_bar_R` (mean of residuals for samples `x_i > t`) for the right side.\n        *   Calculate the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) for the residuals based on these stump predictions: `SSE = sum_L (r_i - r_bar_L)^2 + sum_R (r_i - r_bar_R)^2`.\n        *   Select the split point `t*` (and its corresponding `r_bar_L*`, `r_bar_R*`) that minimizes this SSE.\n        *   **No Valid Split**: If all `x` values are identical (or if there's only one sample), no valid split can be made. In this scenario, the stump predicts the global mean of the current residuals for all samples.\n    *   **Update Predictions**: The overall model prediction `y_hat` is updated by adding the (scaled by `learning_rate`) predictions from the newly trained stump: `y_hat_i = y_hat_i + learning_rate * r_hat_i(t*)`.\n3.  **Final Output**: After all boosting rounds, the final predictions `y_hat` are rounded to four decimal places and returned as a Python list.\n\nWe will use `numpy` for numerical operations, array manipulation, and sorting.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gradient_boosting_1d(x: list[float], y: list[float], n_estimators: int, learning_rate: float = 0.1) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Train a 1-D gradient boosting regressor made of decision stumps.\n\n    Args:\n        x: A list with a single numeric feature for every sample.\n        y: Target values.\n        n_estimators: Number of boosting rounds.\n        learning_rate: Shrinkage applied to every stump (\u03b7).\n\n    Returns:\n        In-sample predictions rounded to 4 decimals and converted to a Python list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure inputs are numpy arrays with float type\n    x_arr = np.array(x, dtype=float)\n    y_arr = np.array(y, dtype=float)\n    n_samples = len(x_arr)\n\n    # Handle empty input\n    if n_samples == 0:\n        return []\n\n    # 1.

{"task_id": 411, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To determine the statistics for actions and observations, we'll process each list (actions and observations) separately using a helper function. This helper function will calculate all the required metrics for a single list of data points.\n\n**Helper Function: `_process_list_data`**\n\nThis function will take a list of data points (e.g., `actions`) and determine:\n1.  `is_tuple_like`: Whether elements are iterables (list, tuple, or multi-dimensional `np.ndarray`). This is determined by checking the type of the first element, assuming all elements have consistent structure.\n2.  `dim`: The dimensionality of each data point. If elements are scalars, `dim` is 1. If they are iterables, `dim` is their length. Special care is taken for empty iterables (e.g., `()`), which result in `dim = 0`.\n3.  `is_multidim`: True if `is_tuple_like` is true and `dim > 1`.\n4.  Normalization: All data points are converted into a `structured_data` format, which is a list of lists. Each inner list contains Python native scalar types (integers or floats). NumPy scalars (like `np.int64`, `np.float32`) or 0-dimensional `np.ndarray`s are converted to their Python equivalents (e.g., `np.int64(5)` becomes `5`, `np.array(3.0)` becomes `3.0`).\n5.  `is_continuous`: Iterates through all values in `structured_data`. If any value is a float `x` such that `x % 1 != 0` (meaning it's not an integer-valued float, e.g., `1.2`, and also correctly handles `NaN` or `Inf`), then `is_continuous` is set to True.\n6.  `n_per_dim_list` and `ids_per_dim_list`: For each dimension, it collects all values, finds the unique ones, sorts them, and then stores the count of unique values (`n_per_dim_list`) and the sorted list of unique values themselves (`ids_per_dim_list`).\n\n**Main Function: `env_stats`**\n\n1.  Calls `_process_list_data` for the `actions` list.\n2.  Calls `_process_list_data` for the `observations` list.\n3.  Assembles the results from these two calls into the final dictionary with the specified keys.\n\n**Edge Cases Handled:**\n*   Empty input lists (`actions` or `observations`): Returns default \"empty\" statistics (e.g., `dim=0`, `is_continuous=False`, empty lists for `n_per_dim` and `ids_per_dim`).\n*   Data points being empty iterables (e.g., `[()]` or `[np.array([])]`): Correctly identifies `dim=0`.\n*   NumPy scalars and 0-dim arrays: Normalized to Python types.\n*   Non-integer floats, including `NaN` and `Inf`: Correctly handled for `is_continuous` check.\n\nThe solution adheres to the problem's assumption that all elements within a single list (`actions` or `observations`) have the same dimensionality.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef env_stats(actions: list, observations: list) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Compute statistics for collections of actions and observations.\n\n    The function inspects *actions* and *observations* and returns a dictionary\n    containing information about dimensionality, data type (discrete or\n    continuous) and the unique values appearing in every dimension.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    actions : list\n        A list with the actions that were taken.

{"task_id": 413, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the simplified Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) regressor, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The GBDT model starts with an initial prediction for all samples. This initial prediction is the mean of the training target values (`y_train`). This will be the baseline for both training and test set predictions.\n\n2.  **Iterative Tree Building**: The model then iteratively builds a sequence of decision trees. In each iteration (`m` from 1 to `n_estimators`):\n    *   **Compute Residuals**: Calculate the residuals, which are the differences between the true target values (`y_train`) and the current accumulated predictions for the training set. For squared-error loss, the negative gradient is simply `y_true - y_pred`. These residuals become the target variable for the tree in the current iteration.\n    *   **Fit a Regression Tree**: A CART (Classification and Regression Tree) is fitted to predict these residuals using the training features (`X_train`). This tree has a limited `max_depth`.\n        *   The tree construction involves finding the best binary split (feature and threshold) at each node.\n        *   The criterion for splitting is the Mean Squared Error (MSE). A split is chosen if it reduces the weighted MSE of the resulting children nodes compared to the parent node's MSE.\n        *   Tree growth stops if `max_depth` is reached, if a node becomes \"pure\" (all target residuals are the same), if a node has too few samples to split (e.g., 1 sample), or if no split can further reduce the MSE.\n        *   Leaf nodes of this tree will store the mean of the residuals for the samples that fall into them.\n    *   **Update Predictions**: The predictions from this newly trained tree (scaled by a `learning_rate`) are added to the accumulated predictions for both the training and test sets.\n        `F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + learning_rate * tree_m(x)`\n\n3.  **Final Prediction**: After `n_estimators` iterations, the final accumulated predictions for the test set (`X_test`) are the output of the GBDT model.\n\n4.  **Output Formatting**: These final predictions must be rounded to 4 decimal places and returned as a Python list.\n\nThe core of this implementation will be a `DecisionTreeRegressorNP` class, built using only NumPy, which handles the fitting and prediction for individual trees.\n\n**Decision Tree Implementation Details (`DecisionTreeRegressorNP`)**:\n*   **Node Structure**: Each tree consists of `Node` objects. A node can be a decision node (with split information: feature index, threshold, left/right children) or a leaf node (with a prediction value).\n*   **`_calculate_mse(y)`**: Computes MSE for a set of target values `y`. `np.var(y)` is used, which is equivalent to `np.mean((y - np.mean(y))**2)`. MSE is 0 if `len(y) <= 1`.\n*   **`_find_best_split(X, y)`**: Iterates through all features and all unique values within each feature as potential thresholds. For each potential split, it calculates the weighted MSE of the children. The split that yields the lowest MSE (and is lower than the parent's MSE) is chosen. If no such split is found, it returns `None`.\n*   **`_build_tree_recursive(X, y, current_depth)`**: Recursively builds the tree. It checks stopping conditions (max_depth, purity, no beneficial split). If not stopping, it finds the best split and calls itself for the left and right children.\n*   **`fit(X, y)`**: Initializes tree construction by calling `_build_tree_recursive`.\n*   **`_predict_sample_recursive(sample, node)`**: Traverses the tree for a single input sample to find the appropriate leaf and its prediction value.\n*   **`predict(X_test)`**: Applies `_predict_sample_recursive` to all samples in `X_test`.\n\nThe main `gbdt_regression` function will orchestrate the boosting process using this tree class.

Reshape `X` accordingly.\n    *   Ensure the `mean` vector is 1D of shape `(d,)`. If it's `(1, d)` or `(d, 1)`, flatten it.\n    *   Handle the case of `X` having zero samples, returning an empty list.\n\n2.  **Matrix Operations**:\n    *   Calculate the determinant of the covariance matrix: \\(\\det(\\Sigma)\\) using `np.linalg.det()`.\n    *   Calculate the inverse of the covariance matrix: \\(\\Sigma^{-1}\\) using `np.linalg.inv()`.\n    *   Check if the covariance matrix is positive-definite (e.g., by ensuring \\(\\det(\\Sigma) > 0\\)).

{"task_id": 435, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the tiny Gradient Boosting Regressor, we will follow the specified algorithm step-by-step. We'll use NumPy for numerical operations, particularly for array manipulations and solving the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) problem.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Input Conversion:** The input lists `X` and `y` will be converted to NumPy arrays of type `float`. This allows for efficient vectorized operations.\n2.  **Initialization:**\n    *   The number of samples, `m`, is determined from the length of `y`.\n    *   If `m` is 0 (no samples), an empty list is returned.\n    *   The initial prediction, `y_hat^(0)`, is set to the mean of the target vector `y`.\n3.  **Special Cases:** If `n_estimators` is less than or equal to 0, or if `learning_rate` is 0, the model makes no updates. In this scenario, the initial predictions (mean of `y`) are returned, rounded to 4 decimal places and formatted as a Python list.\n4.  **Augmenting X:** For the OLS linear model, an intercept term is required. We augment the feature matrix `X` by prepending a column of ones. This augmented matrix, `X_b`, is used by the weak learners.\n5.  **Iterative Boosting:** The core of the algorithm iterates `n_estimators` times:\n    *   **Compute Residuals:** In each iteration `t`, the residuals `r^(t)` are calculated as the difference between the true target values `y` and the current predictions `y_hat^(t-1)`. These residuals are the \"errors\" that the current weak learner will try to predict.\n    *   **Fit OLS Weak Learner:** An OLS linear regression model is fitted to predict the residuals `r^(t)` using the augmented feature matrix `X_b`. We use `np.linalg.lstsq` for this, as it's a robust way to solve OLS problems and handles cases like singular matrices without raising exceptions (which aligns with the \"no exception handling\" constraint).

{"task_id": 439, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "The Apriori algorithm is a classical algorithm for frequent itemset mining. It works iteratively by finding frequent itemsets of size `k` based on frequent itemsets of size `k-1`. The core idea relies on the Apriori property: if an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent. Conversely, if a subset is infrequent, any superset containing it must also be infrequent.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization (k=1):**\n    *   Scan the transaction database to count the support of each individual item. The support of an item is the number of transactions it appears in.\n    *   Identify items whose support meets the `min_sup` threshold (i.e., `support_count >= min_sup * total_transactions`). These form the set of frequent 1-itemsets, denoted as `L1`.\n    *   The items within each 1-itemset (which is a tuple) are inherently sorted. The list `L1` itself is sorted lexicographically to ensure deterministic behavior in subsequent steps and for the final output.\n\n2.  **Iterative Step (for k > 1):**\n    Repeat the following until no more frequent itemsets can be found:\n    *   **Candidate Generation (Ck):**\n        *   Generate candidate `k`-itemsets (`Ck`) from frequent `(k-1)`-itemsets (`Lk-1`). This is typically done by a self-join on `Lk-1`.\n        *   Two itemsets `p` and `q` from `Lk-1` (both of size `k-1` and internally sorted) are joined if their first `k-2` items are identical and the `(k-1)`-th item of `p` is lexicographically smaller than the `(k-1)`-th item of `q`.\n        *   The resulting candidate is formed by merging `p` and the last item of `q`. This new `k`-itemset will also be internally sorted.\n        *   An optimization can be applied here: if `Lk-1` is sorted lexicographically, when joining `itemset1` with `itemset2`, if the prefix of `itemset1` is lexicographically smaller than the prefix of `itemset2`, then no further `itemset2` (for the current `itemset1`) will match `itemset1`'s prefix, so the inner loop can be broken early.\n    *   **Pruning:**\n        *   For each candidate in `Ck`, verify the Apriori property: all of its `(k-1)`-subsets must be present in `Lk-1`.\n        *   If any `(k-1)`-subset of a candidate is not in `Lk-1` (i.e., it's infrequent), that candidate is pruned. `itertools.combinations` is useful for generating these subsets.\n    *   **Support Counting:**\n        *   Scan the transaction database again. For each transaction, determine which of the (pruned) candidates in `Ck` it contains.\n        *   Count the support for each candidate. To do this efficiently, transactions are often converted to sets.\n    *   **Filtering (Lk):**\n        *   From `Ck`, select only those candidates whose support count meets `min_sup_count`. These form the set of frequent `k`-itemsets, `Lk`.\n        *   Sort `Lk` lexicographically.\n    *   If `Lk` is empty, the algorithm terminates. Otherwise, add `Lk` to the collection of all frequent itemsets, set `Lk-1 = Lk`, increment `k`, and repeat.\n\n3.  **Output:**\n    *   The final result is the collection of all frequent itemsets found (`L1, L2, ...`).\n    *   Each itemset is represented as a tuple with its items in ascending lexicographic order.\n    *   The list of frequent itemsets is ordered first by the length of the itemsets and then lexicographically within each length group. This ordering is naturally achieved by appending sorted `L1`, then sorted `L2`, etc.\n\nThe minimum support `min_sup` is given as a fraction. The absolute minimum support count is `min_sup * total_number_of_transactions`. An itemset is frequent if its actual support count is greater than or equal to this value.\n\nThe implementation will use Python's built-in list, set, and dictionary types. `itertools.combinations` will be used for generating subsets during the pruning step. Items are assumed to be hashable and comparable (as per \"lexicographic order\" requirement and the `int` type in the function signature).\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Using Python 3.9+ style type hints for built-in generics (list, dict, set, tuple)\ndef apriori_frequent_itemsets(transactions: list[list[int]], min_sup: float) -> list[tuple]:\n    \"\"\"Find frequent itemsets with the Apriori algorithm.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    transactions : list[list[int]]\n        List of transactions; each transaction is itself a list of items.\n        Items are integers, which are hashable and comparable.\n    min_sup : float\n        Minimum support threshold expressed as a fraction (>0 and \u22641).\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    list[tuple]\n        Frequent itemsets ordered by length and then lexicographically.\n        Each tuple contains items in ascending (lexicographic) order.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    num_transactions = len(transactions)\n    if num_transactions == 0:\n        return []\n\n    # Per problem spec, min_sup is in (0, 1].\n    # If strict validation is needed:\n    # if not (0 < min_sup <= 1):\n    #     raise ValueError(\"min_sup must be in (0, 1]\")\n\n    # Calculate the absolute minimum support count\n    min_sup_count = min_sup * num_transactions\n\n    # Step 1: Generate frequent 1-itemsets (L1)\n    # Count support for each individual item.\n    # Support of an item = number of transactions containing that item.\n    item_support_counts: dict[int, int] = {} \n    for transaction in transactions:\n        # Consider unique items within this transaction for support counting\n        unique_items_in_transaction: set[int] = set(transaction)\n        for item in unique_items_in_transaction:\n            item_support_counts[item] = item_support_counts.get(item, 0) + 1\n            \n    # L1: list of 1-itemsets (tuples of a single item)\n    # Each itemset is a tuple, e.g., (item,)\n    L1: list[tuple[int, ...]] = [] \n    for item, count in item_support_counts.items():\n        if count >= min_sup_count:\n            L1.append((item,))\n    \n    # Sort L1 lexicographically.

{"task_id": 444, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Input Validation and Preparation**:\n    *   Convert `X` (and `Y` if provided) from Python lists of lists into NumPy arrays for efficient numerical computation. We'll use `dtype=float` to handle both integers and floats in the input.\n    *   Validate the structure of `X` and `Y`:\n        *   They must be lists.\n        *   If not empty, they must effectively represent 2D matrices (lists of 1D vectors of consistent length). `np.array()` conversion and checking `ndim` will help here.\n        *   If `X` is an empty list (`N=0`), the result should be an empty list.\n        *   If `Y` is an empty list (`M=0`):\n            *   If `X` has features (`C > 0`), this is a feature dimension mismatch (C features vs. 0 features for `Y`), so return -1.\n            *   If `X` also has no features (`C = 0`), it's compatible. The resulting kernel matrix will have `N` rows and 0 columns (e.g., `[[], [], ...]` if `N > 0`).\n    *   Determine `N` (number of samples in `X`) and `C` (number of features).\n    *   If `Y` is provided, determine `M` (number of samples in `Y`) and `C_Y` (features in `Y`). `C_Y` must match `C`. If not, return -1.\n    *   If `Y` is `None`, set `Y` to be `X`, so `M=N`.\n\n2.  **Sigma (\u03c3) Parameter Validation**:\n    *   If `sigma` is `None`: Use the default value `\u221a(C/2)`.\n        *   If `C=0`, this default becomes 0, which is non-positive. Return -1.\n        *   Otherwise, `sigma` will be a positive scalar.\n    *   If `sigma` is a single float: It must be positive.

(We will also check for finiteness, assuming scale parameters should not be `inf` or `NaN`).\n    *   If `sigma` is of any other type, it's invalid; return -1.\n\n3.  **Kernel Matrix Computation**:\n    *   Initialize an empty kernel matrix `K` of shape `(N, M)` as a Python list of lists.\n    *   Iterate `i` from `0` to `N-1` (for each vector `x_i` in `X`):\n        *   Iterate `j` from `0` to `M-1` (for each vector `y_j` in `Y`):\n            *   Calculate the term `S = \u03a3_k ((x_{ik} - y_{jk}) / \u03c3_k)^2`.\n                *   If `C=0` (no features), `S = 0`.\n                *   If `sigma` is isotropic (a scalar `\u03c3`): `S = (1/\u03c3^2) * \u03a3_k (x_{ik} - y_{jk})^2`. The sum is the squared Euclidean distance `||x_i - y_j||^2`.\n                *   If `sigma` is anisotropic (a list `[\u03c3_0, ..., \u03c3_{C-1}]`): `S = \u03a3_k ((x_{ik} - y_{jk}) / \u03c3_k)^2`.\n            *   Calculate the kernel value `k(x_i, y_j) = exp(-0.5 * S)`.\n            *   Round this value to 4 decimal places.\n            *   Store it in `K[i][j]`.\n\n4.  **Return Result**:\n    *   Return the computed kernel matrix (a nested Python list).

This is needed for the gain calculation of every potential split.\n    *   Initialize variables to store the best split found so far: `max_gain` (initialized to 0.0, as gain must be positive), `best_feature_index` (e.g., -1), `best_threshold` (e.g., `float('inf')` to correctly handle the \"smallest threshold\" tie-breaking rule), and placeholders for majority labels of the children.\n    *   A small `epsilon` (e.g., 1e-9) will be used for floating-point comparisons, particularly to ensure gain is strictly positive.\n\n2.  **Iterating Through Features and Thresholds**:\n    *   Loop through each feature index `j` from `0` to `n_features - 1`.\n        *   For the current feature `X_np[:, j]`:\n            *   Find all unique sorted values in this feature column.\n            *   If there are fewer than two unique values, no split is possible for this feature, so continue to the next feature.\n            *   Candidate thresholds `t` are defined as the mid-points between successive distinct sorted values. Loop through these `t`.\n                *   For each `(j, t)` pair (a candidate split):\n                    *   Divide the dataset into two subsets:\n                        *   `left_child`: samples where `X_np[i, j] <= t`.\n                        *   `right_child`: samples where `X_np[i, j] > t`.\n                    *   Collect the labels corresponding to these samples: `y_left` and `y_right`.\n                    *   If either `y_left` or `y_right` is empty, this split doesn't actually partition the data. Such splits result in zero information gain (if the parent is not pure) and should be skipped.\n                    *   Calculate the proportions of samples going to each child: `p_left = len(y_left) / n_samples` and `p_right = len(y_right) / n_samples`.\n                    *   Calculate the Shannon entropy for `y_left` (`H_left`) and `y_right` (`H_right`).\n                    *   Compute the information gain: `Gain = H_parent - (p_left * H_left + p_right * H_right)`.\n\n3.  **Updating the Best Split**:\n    *   Compare `Gain` with `max_gain` (stored in `current_best_split_params[\"gain\"]`):\n        *   If `Gain` is greater than `max_gain` (by more than `epsilon`): This is a new best split. Update `max_gain`, `best_feature_index = j`, `best_threshold = t`, and calculate and store `left_majority_label` and `right_majority_label` for `y_left` and `y_right`.\n        *   If `Gain` is approximately equal to `max_gain` (within `epsilon`): Apply tie-breaking rules:\n            1.  If `j` is less than the current `best_feature_index`: This split is preferred. Update all best split parameters.\n            2.  If `j` is equal to the current `best_feature_index` AND `t` is less than the current `best_threshold`: This split is preferred. Update all best split parameters.\n\n4.  **Handling No Improvement**:\n    *   After checking all features and thresholds, if `max_gain` is not strictly greater than 0 (i.e., `max_gain <= epsilon`), it means no split could increase the information gain.\n    *   In this case, calculate the `majority_label` for the entire original `y_np`.\n    *   Return `(-1, None, majority_label, majority_label)`.\n\n5.  **Returning the Best Split**:\n    *   If a split with `max_gain > epsilon` was found:\n    *   Return `(best_feature_index, round(best_threshold, 4), left_majority_label, right_majority_label)`.\n\n**Helper Functions**:\n\n*   `_calculate_entropy(labels)`:\n    *   Takes a NumPy array of labels.\n    *   If empty, returns 0.\n    *   Calculates proportions `p_k` of each unique class label.\n    *   Returns `- sum(p_k * log2(p_k))` for `p_k > 0`.\n*   `_calculate_majority_label(labels)`:\n    *   Takes a NumPy array of labels (assumed non-empty based on usage).\n    *   Counts occurrences of each unique label.\n    *   Finds the maximum count.\n    *   Identifies all labels achieving this maximum count.\n    *   Returns the smallest among these candidate labels (tie-breaking).\n\nThis approach systematically evaluates all valid splits and adheres to the specified information gain calculation and tie-breaking rules.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Helper functions defined at the module level for clarity and reusability.\n\ndef _calculate_entropy(labels: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Calculates Shannon entropy for a set of labels.\"\"\"\n    if labels.size == 0:\n        # An empty set has zero entropy by convention in this context.\n        return 0.0\n    \n    # Find unique labels and their counts\n    _, counts = np.unique(labels, return_counts=True)\n    # Calculate probabilities of each label\n    probabilities = counts / labels.size\n    \n    # Shannon entropy formula: H(S) = - sum(p_k * log2(p_k))\n    # We only sum for p_k > 0, as 0 * log2(0) is conventionally taken as 0.\n    entropy = -np.sum(p * np.log2(p) for p in probabilities if p > 0)\n    return entropy\n\ndef _calculate_majority_label(labels: np.ndarray) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the majority label in a set of labels.\n    Ties are broken by choosing the smallest label value.\n    Assumes labels is non-empty, as per usage in decision_stump.\n    \"\"\"\n    unique_labels, counts = np.unique(labels, return_counts=True)\n    \n    max_count = np.max(counts)\n    # Identify all labels that have the maximum count\n    majority_candidates = unique_labels[counts == max_count]\n    \n    # Resolve ties by selecting the smallest label value among candidates\n    return np.min(majority_candidates)\n\n\ndef decision_stump(X: list[list[float]], y: list[int]) -> tuple:\n    \"\"\"Find a decision stump that maximises information gain.\n\n    A *decision stump* is a one-level decision tree: it chooses one feature and\n    one threshold to split the dataset into two parts.

{"task_id": 452, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To partition a dataset `X` based on a feature `feature_i` and a `threshold`, we need to handle two main cases for the threshold type: numeric and categorical. The resulting subsets must maintain the original order of samples and be returned as Python lists of lists.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the implementation strategy:\n\n1.  **Input Handling**:\n    *   The input `X` can be a Python `List[list]` or a NumPy `ndarray`. For consistent processing, it's best to convert `X` into a NumPy array. Using `dtype=object` during conversion ensures that mixed data types (e.g., numbers and strings in the same column) are handled correctly, and comparisons behave as expected (Python's native comparisons).\n    *   Edge cases for `X` need consideration:\n        *   If `X` is empty (contains no samples), both resulting subsets should be empty lists.\n        *   If `X` is not a 2-D structure (e.g., a 1-D list or array), it's invalid input as per the problem's implication of \"list of samples\" or \"2-D array\". An error should be raised.\n        *   If `X` has samples but no features (e.g., `X = [[]]` results in a NumPy array of shape `(1,0)`), no feature-based split is possible. In this scenario, all samples fall into the second subset.\n\n2.  **Feature Extraction**:\n    *   Once `X` is a 2-D NumPy array (`X_np`), the column corresponding to `feature_i` is extracted (e.g., `X_np[:, feature_i]`).\n    *   If `feature_i` is out of bounds for the array's dimensions, NumPy will raise an `IndexError`. This is standard behavior for invalid indexing.\n\n3.  **Splitting Logic**:\n    *   Determine if the `threshold` is numeric (an `int` or `float`).\n    *   **Numeric Threshold**: If numeric, the first subset includes samples where the value in the `feature_i` column is greater than or equal to (`>=`) the `threshold`.\n        *   To handle potential `TypeError` if a non-numeric value in the column is compared with the numeric threshold (e.g., a string compared to a number), each comparison can be wrapped in a `try-except` block. If a `TypeError` occurs for a sample, that sample does not meet the condition.\n    *   **Categorical Threshold**: If not numeric, the first subset includes samples where the value is exactly equal (`==`) to the `threshold`.\n    *   A boolean mask is created based on these conditions. This mask identifies samples belonging to the first subset.\n\n4.  **Subset Creation**:\n    *   The boolean mask is applied to `X_np` to get the first subset (`subset1_np`).\n    *   The inverse of the mask (`~mask`) is used to get the second subset (`subset2_np`), which contains all remaining samples.\n    *   NumPy's boolean array indexing inherently preserves the relative order of the selected samples.\n\n5.  **Output Formatting**:\n    *   Both `subset1_np` and `subset2_np` (which are NumPy arrays) must be converted to regular Python lists of lists. The `ndarray.tolist()` method achieves this.\n    *   The function returns a list containing these two subsets: `[subset1_list, subset2_list]`.\n\nThis approach ensures that all requirements, including order preservation, output format, and handling of different threshold types, are met.

Each new stump aims to correct the errors made by the previous ensemble.\n\nAlgorithm Steps:\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Convert input lists `x` and `y` to NumPy arrays.\n    *   Handle the edge case of empty input data (return an empty list).\n    *   The initial prediction `y_hat` for all samples is set to the mean of the target values `y`.\n    *   If `n_estimators` is zero or negative, these initial mean predictions (rounded) are returned.\n\n2.  **Iterative Boosting**:\n    *   Loop `n_estimators` times:\n        *   **Compute Residuals**: Calculate the residuals `r_i = y_i - y_hat_i`. These are the errors that the next stump will try to predict.\n        *   **Early Stopping**: If all residuals are zero, the model has perfectly fit the data, so we can stop early.\n        *   **Find Best Stump**:\n            *   Identify unique values in `x` to serve as potential split points. Valid split points `t` are all unique `x` values except the greatest one.\n            *   If no potential splits exist (e.g., all `x` values are identical or only one sample), the stump will predict the mean of all current residuals for all samples.\n            *   Otherwise, for each potential split `t`:\n                *   Divide the data into a \"left\" set (`x_i <= t`) and a \"right\" set (`x_i > t`). The problem implies that splits resulting in empty sides should be ignored, but our choice of `t` from `unique_x_values[:-1]` ensures non-empty sides if there's more than one unique `x` value.\n                *   For each side, calculate the mean of the residuals on that side.

{"task_id": 471, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement one step of the on-policy TD(0) Expected SARSA algorithm, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Expected Value at the Next State (`s'`)**:\n    The core of Expected SARSA lies in how it calculates the value of the next state. Instead of picking a single action `a'` based on the policy (like SARSA) or picking the greedy action (like Q-learning), Expected SARSA considers the expectation over all possible actions `a'` in state `s'`, weighted by their probabilities under the current policy `\u03c0(a'|s')`.\n\n    The policy `\u03c0(a'|s')` is an \u03b5-soft policy derived from the current Q-table:\n    *   `\u03c0(a'|s') = 1 - \u03b5 + \u03b5/|A|` if `a'` is the greedy action in `s'`.\n    *   `\u03c0(a'|s') = \u03b5/|A|` if `a'` is a non-greedy action in `s'`.\n    Here, `|A|` is the number of actions. The problem specifies that if there are multiple greedy actions (actions with the same maximum Q-value), ties are resolved by considering the first one as \"the\" greedy action for the purpose of probability assignment.\n\n    The expected value `E[Q(s', a') | s']` is then `\u03a3_{a'} \u03c0(a'|s') * Q(s', a')`.\n    This sum can be rewritten more conveniently:\n    Let `Q_max(s')` be the Q-value of the (first) greedy action in `s'`.\n    `E[Q(s', a') | s'] = (1 - \u03b5) * Q_max(s') + (\u03b5/|A|) * \u03a3_{a'} Q(s', a')`.\n    This formula is used for calculation.\n\n    *   If `next_state` is `None` (i.e., `s'` is a terminal state), the expected future value is 0.\n    *   If `next_state` is non-terminal but has no actions (`|A|=0`), the expected future value is also treated as 0. This is an edge case, as typical RL environments have a fixed, non-zero number of actions.\n\n2.  **Calculate the TD Target**:\n    The TD target is `r + \u03b3 * E[Q(s', a') | s']`, where `r` is the immediate reward and `\u03b3` is the discount factor.\n\n3.  **Update the Q-value**:\n    The Q-value for the state-action pair `(s, a)` that was experienced is updated using the TD error:\n    `Q(s, a) \u2190 Q(s, a) + lr * (TD_target - Q(s, a))`, where `lr` is the learning rate.\n\n4.  **Round the Q-table**:\n    Finally, all entries in the entire Q-table must be rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThe implementation will use `numpy.max()` to find the maximum Q-value in the next state, which corresponds to `Q_max(s')`. Standard Python `sum()` will be used for `\u03a3_{a'} Q(s', a')`.

Adam corrects for this bias:\n    *   `m\u0302_t = m_t / (1\u2212\u03b2\u2081\u1d57)`\n    *   `v\u0302_t = v_t / (1\u2212\u03b2\u2082\u1d57)`\n    Here, `t` is the current time step (1-indexed).\n4.  **Update Parameters**: The parameters `w` are updated using the bias-corrected moments:\n    *   `w_new = w \u2212 \u03b1 * m\u0302_t / (\u221av\u0302_t + \u03b5)`\n    `\u03b1` is the `learning_rate`, and `\u03b5` (`eps`) is a small constant for numerical stability, preventing division by zero. `\u221av\u0302_t` is the element-wise square root.\n5.  **Return Values**: The function should return a tuple `(w_new, m_t, v_t)`. Note that the returned moments `m_new` and `v_new` are the biased estimates `m_t` and `v_t`, as these are what will be used as `m_prev` and `v_prev` in the subsequent optimization step.\n\nThe implementation needs to handle both scalar inputs and NumPy array inputs for `w` and `grad`. NumPy's arithmetic operations and universal functions (like `np.sqrt`) naturally handle both scalars and arrays, simplifying the implementation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef adam_update(w, grad, m_prev, v_prev, t, learning_rate=0.001, b1=0.9, b2=0.999, eps=1e-8):\n    \"\"\"Perform a single Adam optimisation step.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    w : float | np.ndarray\n        Current value of the parameter(s) to be updated.\n    grad : float | np.ndarray\n        Gradient of the loss with respect to ``w``.\n    m_prev : float | np.ndarray | None\n        Previous estimate of the first moment (mean of gradients).\n    v_prev : float | np.ndarray | None\n        Previous estimate of the second moment (uncentred variance of gradients).\n    t : int\n        Time step (must start at 1 and increase by one on every call).\n        It's crucial that t is 1-indexed (starts at 1).\n    learning_rate : float, default 0.001\n        Step size ``\u03b1``.\n    b1 : float, default 0.9\n        Exponential decay rate for the first moment.\n    b2 : float, default 0.999\n        Exponential decay rate for the second moment.\n    eps : float, default 1e-8\n        Small constant added to the denominator for numerical stability.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple\n        ``(w_new, m_new, v_new)`` where:\n        * ``w_new`` \u2013 updated parameters (same shape and broadly same type as ``w``)\n        * ``m_new`` \u2013 updated first moment (corresponds to m_t in Adam paper, to be used as m_prev in next step)\n        * ``v_new`` \u2013 updated second moment (corresponds to v_t in Adam paper, to be used as v_prev in next step)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize moments if they are None.\n    # Their type (scalar or ndarray) should match w's type.\n    # w and grad are guaranteed to have the same shape.\n    if m_prev is None:\n        if isinstance(w, np.ndarray):\n            # If w is a NumPy array, m_prev becomes a NumPy array of zeros.\n            # dtype=float ensures moments are float, even if w was an int array (unlikely for params).\n            m_prev = np.zeros_like(w, dtype=float)\n        else:\n            # If w is a Python scalar, m_prev becomes a Python float 0.0.\n            m_prev = 0.0\n    \n    if v_prev is None:\n        if isinstance(w, np.ndarray):\n            v_prev = np.zeros_like(w, dtype=float)\n        else:\n            v_prev = 0.0\n\n    # Adam hyperparameter names mapping to standard notation:\n    # \u03b1 (alpha) is learning_rate\n    # \u03b2\u2081 (beta1) is b1\n    # \u03b2\u2082 (beta2) is b2\n    # \u03b5 (epsilon) is eps\n\n    # Update biased first moment estimate (m_t)\n    # Formula: m_t = \u03b2\u2081 * m_{t\u22121} + (1\u2212\u03b2\u2081) * grad\n    m_t = b1 * m_prev + (1 - b1) * grad\n\n    # Update biased second raw moment estimate (v_t)\n    # Formula: v_t = \u03b2\u2082 * v_{t\u22121} + (1\u2212\u03b2\u2082) * grad\u00b2\n    # grad**2 performs element-wise squaring for ndarrays and standard power for scalars.\n    v_t = b2 * v_prev + (1 - b2) * (grad**2)\n\n    # Compute bias-corrected first moment estimate (m\u0302_t)\n    # Formula: m\u0302_t = m_t / (1\u2212\u03b2\u2081\u1d57)\n    # t is the time step, 1-indexed.\n    m_hat_t = m_t / (1 - b1**t)\n\n    # Compute bias-corrected second raw moment estimate (v\u0302_t)\n    # Formula: v\u0302_t = v_t / (1\u2212\u03b2\u2082\u1d57)\n    v_hat_t = v_t / (1 - b2**t)\n\n    # Update parameters (w_new)\n    # Formula: w_new = w \u2212 \u03b1 * m\u0302_t / (\u221av\u0302_t + \u03b5)\n    # np.sqrt works element-wise for ndarrays and correctly for scalars.\n    # If v_hat_t is a Python float, np.sqrt(v_hat_t) returns a np.float64.\n    # If v_hat_t is an ndarray, np.sqrt(v_hat_t) returns an ndarray.\n    denominator = np.sqrt(v_hat_t) + eps\n    w_new = w - learning_rate * m_hat_t / denominator\n    \n    # The function returns the new parameter w_new,\n    # and the updated (biased) moments m_t and v_t.

{"task_id": 485, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the univariate regression tree, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Main Function `regression_tree_predict`**:\n    *   Handle the edge case of an empty training set (`X_train`), returning an empty list as required.\n    *   Convert the input lists `X_train` and `y_train` to NumPy arrays for efficient numerical operations. We'll ensure they use `float` data type for consistency in calculations (e.g., means, midpoints for splits).\n    *   Call a recursive helper function, `_build_tree`, to construct the decision tree.\n    *   Once the tree is built, iterate through `X_test`. For each test sample, use another helper function, `_predict_one_sample`, to traverse the tree and get the prediction.\n    *   Collect all predictions into a list of floats and return it.\n\n2.  **Tree Node Structure**:\n    *   We'll represent tree nodes using Python dictionaries.\n    *   A **leaf node** will look like: `{'is_leaf': True, 'value': float}` where `value` is the mean of target values in that leaf.\n    *   An **internal (split) node** will look like: `{'is_leaf': False, 'threshold': float, 'left': dict, 'right': dict}` where `threshold` is the split point, and `left` and `right` are dictionaries representing the child nodes.\n\n3.  **Helper Function `_calculate_sse(y_values_np)`**:\n    *   Takes a NumPy array of target values.\n    *   Calculates the mean of these values.\n    *   Computes the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) as `sum((y_i - mean_y)^2)`.\n    *   Returns the SSE as a float. If the input array is empty, SSE is 0.\n\n4.  **Helper Function `_find_best_split(X_node_np, y_node_np)`**:\n    *   Takes the feature values (`X_node_np`) and target values (`y_node_np`) for the current node.\n    *   Identifies potential split points: These are the midpoints between consecutive unique sorted values of `X_node_np`. If there are fewer than two unique `X` values, no split is possible.\n    *   For each potential split point (threshold):\n        *   Divide the data into two sets: left (`X <= threshold`) and right (`X > threshold`).\n        *   A split is only considered valid if it results in two non-empty children. This prevents issues with empty nodes later.\n        *   Calculate the total SSE for this split: `SSE_left_child + SSE_right_child`, using `_calculate_sse` for each child's target values.\n    *   The split point that minimizes this total SSE is chosen as the best split.\n    *   Returns the best threshold, and the indices of samples going to the left and right children. If no valid split is found (e.g., all `X` values are identical, or no split creates two non-empty children), it returns `None`.\n\n5.  **Helper Function `_build_tree(current_X_np, current_y_np, current_depth)`**:\n    *   This is the recursive function for building the tree.\n    *   **Stopping Conditions**:\n        1.  If `current_depth` equals `max_depth`.\n        2.  If the current node contains fewer than two training samples (`len(current_y_np) < 2`).\n        3.  If `_find_best_split` returns `None` (i.e., no valid split can be made, e.g., all `X` values in the node are identical).\n        *   If any of these conditions are met, a leaf node is created. Its value is the mean of `current_y_np`.\n    *   **Recursive Step**:\n        *   If none of the stopping conditions are met, call `_find_best_split` to get the best split threshold and data indices for children.\n        *   Create an internal node with this threshold.\n        *   Recursively call `_build_tree` for the left child (samples `X <= threshold`) and right child (samples `X > threshold`), incrementing `current_depth`.\n        *   The results of these recursive calls become the `left` and `right` children of the current internal node.\n    *   Returns the created node (either leaf or internal).\n\n6.  **Helper Function `_predict_one_sample(x_value, node)`**:\n    *   Takes a single test feature value `x_value` and the current tree `node`.\n    *   If `node` is a leaf (`node['is_leaf'] == True`), return `node['value']`.\n    *   If `node` is an internal node, compare `x_value` with `node['threshold']`.\n        *   If `x_value <= node['threshold']`, recursively call `_predict_one_sample` on the `node['left']` child.\n        *   Otherwise, recursively call on the `node['right']` child.\n    *   Returns the predicted float value.\n\nAll helper functions will be nested within `regression_tree_predict` to keep the solution self-contained.

{"task_id": 491, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "The FP-Growth algorithm mines frequent item-sets from a transaction database. It operates in two main phases:\n1.  **FP-tree Construction:**\n    *   The database is scanned once to find the support (frequency count) of each individual item.\n    *   Items with support less than `min_sup` (minimum support) are discarded.\n    *   The remaining frequent items are sorted in descending order of their support. This sorted list is often called the \"F-list\".\n    *   A second scan of the database is performed. For each transaction:\n        *   Infrequent items are removed.\n        *   The remaining frequent items are ordered according to the F-list.\n        *   This ordered transaction is inserted into an FP-tree. The FP-tree is a compact representation of the database where common prefixes are shared.\n    *   A header table is maintained alongside the FP-tree. For each frequent item, it stores the total support and a pointer to the first node in the FP-tree representing that item. Nodes representing the same item are linked together using `node_link` pointers.\n\n2.  **Recursive Mining (FP-Growth):**\n    *   The algorithm recursively mines the FP-tree to find frequent item-sets.\n    *   It starts by picking an item from the F-list (typically the least frequent one first). Let this be `item_P`.\n    *   All item-sets ending with `item_P` are found by:\n        *   Constructing `item_P`'s **conditional pattern base**: This consists of all prefix paths in the FP-tree that co-occur with `item_P`. Each path in the conditional pattern base has a count equal to the support of `item_P` on that path.\n        *   Building a **conditional FP-tree** from this conditional pattern base. This is like building a new FP-tree, but the \"transactions\" are the paths from the conditional pattern base, and `min_sup` is still applied to item counts within this conditional context.\n        *   If the conditional FP-tree is not empty, the algorithm recursively mines it with `item_P` added to the current prefix.\n    *   The item-set formed by `(current_prefix + item_P)` is frequent and added to the results.\n    *   **Single Path Optimization:** If at any point a conditional FP-tree (or the initial FP-tree) consists of only a single path, all combinations of items on that path, when appended to the current prefix, form frequent item-sets. These can be generated directly without further recursion for that branch.\n\nThe final list of frequent item-sets is sorted first by length and then lexicographically. Items within each item-set (tuple) are also sorted lexicographically.\n\nThe implementation involves:\n*   An `FPNode` class to represent nodes in the FP-tree.\n*   Helper functions for tree insertion (`_insert_tree`), checking for single paths (`_is_single_path`), and the main recursive mining logic (`_fp_growth_mine_recursive`).\n*   The main `fp_growth` function orchestrates the two phases and handles initial setup and final result formatting.\n\n```python\nimport collections # For Counter\nimport itertools   # For combinations\n\n# FP-Node structure\nclass FPNode:\n    def __init__(self, item, count, parent):\n        self.item = item\n        self.count = count\n        self.parent = parent\n        self.children = {}  # item_name -> FPNode\n        self.node_link = None  # Link to next node with same item_name\n\n# Helper to insert a transaction into the FP-tree\ndef _insert_tree(items, node, header_table, count_increment):\n    if not items:\n        return\n\n    first_item = items[0]\n    remaining_items = items[1:]\n\n    child_node = node.children.get(first_item)\n    if child_node is None:\n        child_node = FPNode(first_item, 0, node) # Count will be incremented below\n        node.children[first_item] = child_node\n        \n        # Link to header table: new node becomes head of the linked list for this item\n        # This item must be in the header_table as it's from a pre-filtered/sorted transaction\n        child_node.node_link = header_table[first_item][0]\n        header_table[first_item][0] = child_node\n    \n    child_node.count += count_increment\n\n    if remaining_items:\n        _insert_tree(remaining_items, child_node, header_table, count_increment)\n\n# Helper to check if tree is a single path and collect path items\ndef _is_single_path(node):\n    # node is typically tree_root (or conditional tree_root)\n    # Returns list of (item, count_on_node) on path if single, else None.\n    # Path items are items on this path, starting from children of 'node'.\n    \n    path_collector = []\n    current_node_on_path = node \n\n    while True:\n        num_children = len(current_node_on_path.children)\n        if num_children > 1:\n            return None # Fork in path, not a single path tree\n        \n        if num_children == 0: # Reached end of path (leaf or empty tree from this node)\n            break \n        \n        # Exactly one child\n        child_node = list(current_node_on_path.children.values())[0]\n        path_collector.append((child_node.item, child_node.count))\n        current_node_on_path = child_node\n        \n    return path_collector\n\n# Recursive mining function\ndef _fp_growth_mine_recursive(tree_root, current_header_table, min_sup, prefix, frequent_itemsets_result, items_to_iterate_ordered):\n    # Single path optimization:\n    # If tree_root (or conditional tree_root) leads to a single path of items\n    path_from_root = _is_single_path(tree_root)\n    \n    if path_from_root is not None: \n        # If it's a single path, generate all combinations\n        path_items_only = [p_item for p_item, p_count in path_from_root]\n        for i in range(1, len(path_items_only) + 1):\n            for comb_items in itertools.combinations(path_items_only, i):\n                new_itemset = prefix + comb_items\n                # Ensure items within the tuple are sorted lexicographically\n                frequent_itemsets_result.append(tuple(sorted(list(new_itemset))))\n        return\n\n    # General case: iterate items in header table (from least frequent in current_header_table's F-list)\n    # items_to_iterate_ordered is the F-list for the current (conditional) tree.

{"task_id": 492, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To generate polynomial features, we need to create new features that are products of the original features raised to certain powers. The total degree of these products (sum of powers) should not exceed a given maximum degree `d`. The features should be ordered first by their total degree, and then lexicographically based on the indices of the original features involved.\n\nThe process can be broken down as follows:\n\n1.  **Input Validation**:\n    *   If the `degree` is negative, the function must return `-1`.\n    *   If the input data `X` is empty (i.e., `n_samples = 0`), an empty list `[]` should be returned.\n\n2.  **Data Preparation**:\n    *   Convert the input list of lists `X` into a NumPy array `X_np` with `dtype=float`. This facilitates numerical computations and vectorized operations.\n    *   Determine the number of samples (`n_samples`) and original features (`n_features`) from the shape of `X_np`.\n\n3.  **Generating Feature Definitions**:\n    *   We need a systematic way to define each new polynomial feature. A feature can be represented by a tuple of indices of the original features that are multiplied together. For example, if original features are `x\u2080, x\u2081`, the term `x\u2080\u00b2 * x\u2081` corresponds to multiplying the feature at index 0 twice and the feature at index 1 once. This can be represented by the tuple `(0, 0, 1)`.\n    *   Iterate `current_degree` from 0 up to `degree` (inclusive).\n        *   For `current_degree = 0`, the only term is the constant 1. This corresponds to an empty tuple `()`.\n        *   For `current_degree > 0`, use `itertools.combinations_with_replacement(range(n_features), current_degree)` to get all unique combinations of feature indices that form a product of that degree. `combinations_with_replacement` ensures that the indices in each tuple are sorted and that the tuples themselves are generated in lexicographic order. This satisfies the problem's ordering requirements.\n    *   Store all these generated tuples (feature definitions) in a list.\n\n4.  **Computing Polynomial Features**:\n    *   Create an empty NumPy array `X_poly_np` of shape `(n_samples, num_output_features)` and `dtype=float` to store the new features. `num_output_features` is the total count of feature definitions generated in the previous step.\n    *   Iterate through the `feature_definitions` list. For each `indices_tuple` (defining a polynomial term) and its corresponding column index `j` in `X_poly_np`:\n        *   If `indices_tuple` is empty (the degree-0 term), set the `j`-th column of `X_poly_np` to `1.0`.\n        *   Otherwise, `indices_tuple` contains indices of original features. Select these features for all samples: `X_np[:, list(indices_tuple)]`. This results in an array where each row contains the original feature values needed for the current monomial for that sample.\n        *   Compute the product of these selected features for each sample (row-wise product) using `np.prod(..., axis=1)`. Assign this result to the `j`-th column of `X_poly_np`.\n\n5.  **Output**:\n    *   Convert the populated NumPy array `X_poly_np` to a Python list of lists using its `tolist()` method. This is the final result.\n\nThis approach handles edge cases like `n_features = 0` (e.g., `X = [[]]`) correctly. If `n_features = 0`, `combinations_with_replacement(range(0), 0)` yields `(())`, and for `current_degree > 0`, it yields nothing. So, only the degree-0 term (1) is generated.

{"task_id": 496, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the `apply_affine` function, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Input Processing**:\n    *   The input `x` can be a Python scalar (int/float), a Python list of numbers, or a NumPy array.\n    *   We will convert `x` into a 1-D NumPy array of floats. This ensures consistent handling for all input types and facilitates element-wise operations.\n    *   Using `np.array(x, dtype=float)` will convert scalars and lists to NumPy arrays.\n    *   To ensure the resulting array is strictly 1-D (as implied by \"input vector\" and the `list[float]` return type for `y`, `grad`, `grad2`), we will call the `.flatten()` method on the NumPy array. This handles:\n        *   Scalars (e.g., `5` or `np.array(5)`): `np.array(5).flatten()` results in `np.array([5.])`.\n        *   1-D lists/arrays (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`): These are converted to 1-D NumPy arrays; `flatten()` effectively returns a copy.\n        *   N-D lists/arrays (e.g., `[[1,2],[3,4]]`): These are flattened into a 1-D array (e.g., `np.array([1., 2., 3., 4.])`).\n        *   Empty lists (e.g., `[]`): These become empty 1-D NumPy arrays.\n\n2.  **Calculations**:\n    *   **Activation `y`**: Calculated element-wise as `y[i] = slope * x[i] + intercept`. Using NumPy arrays, this is `y_arr = slope * x_arr + intercept`.\n    *   **First Derivative `grad`**: The derivative of `slope * x + intercept` with respect to `x` is `slope`. For an input vector, this means each element of the gradient vector `grad` will be equal to `slope`. We can create this using `np.full_like(x_arr, slope)`.\n    *   **Second Derivative `grad2`**: The derivative of `slope` (a constant) with respect to `x` is `0`. So, each element of `grad2` will be `0`.

If not, return -1. Also, handle the edge case of `n_samples = 0`.\n\n2.  **Standardise Data**:\n    *   For each feature (column) in the data:\n        *   Calculate its mean.\n        *   Subtract the mean to center the feature (make its mean zero).\n        *   Calculate its *population* standard deviation (`ddof=0`).\n        *   If the population standard deviation is non-zero, divide the centered feature by it. This makes the feature have a population variance of 1.\n        *   If the population standard deviation is zero (i.e., the feature was constant), the feature becomes all zeros after centering. It is left as such, as per the problem statement: \"If a feature has zero variance, leave it unchanged (all zeros after centring).\"\n\n3.  **Compute Sample Covariance Matrix**:\n    *   Use the standardised data from the previous step.\n    *   Calculate the sample covariance matrix. This involves using Bessel's correction, meaning the sum of squared deviations is divided by `n_samples - 1` (`ddof=1` in NumPy's `cov` function).\n    *   If `n_samples <= 1`, the denominator `n_samples - 1` would be zero or negative.

{"task_id": 520, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the `sigmoid_grad` function, we need to handle several input types: Python scalars (integers or floats), Python lists (1-D or 2-D nested), and NumPy arrays (0-D, 1-D, or 2-D). The function should also correctly process NumPy scalar types like `np.float64`. The core calculation for any input element `x` (which is a sigmoid output, $g(z)$) is $x \\times (1-x)$. All results must be rounded to 4 decimal places using `numpy.round()`, and the output type must match the \"rank\" of the input: a Python float for scalar input, and a Python list (or nested list) for list or array inputs.\n\nThe implementation strategy will be:\n1.  **Handle NumPy arrays**: If the input `z` is an `np.ndarray`, perform the element-wise calculation `z * (1-z)`. Then, round the resulting array using `np.round(result_array, 4)`. If the array is 0-dimensional (a NumPy scalar wrapped in an array), convert its value to a Python float using `.item()`. Otherwise (for 1-D or 2-D arrays), convert the array to a Python list (or nested list) using `.tolist()`.\n2.  **Handle scalar inputs**: If `z` is a Python `int` or `float`, or a NumPy scalar type (checked using `isinstance(z, np.generic)`), calculate `val = z * (1-z)`. Round this value using `rounded_val = np.round(val, 4)`. Since `np.round` might return a NumPy scalar type (e.g., `np.float64`) or a Python native type (e.g., `float`, or `int` if the result is a whole number like 0), we ensure the final returned value is a Python `float`. This is done by checking if `rounded_val` is an `np.generic` (if so, use `.item()`) or otherwise by explicitly casting to `float` (e.g., `float(0)` becomes `0.0`).\n3.  **Handle Python lists**: If `z` is a Python `list`, use a list comprehension to recursively call `sigmoid_grad` on each element: `[sigmoid_grad(element) for element in z]`. This elegantly handles empty lists (returns `[]`), 1-D lists (elements become floats), and 2-D nested lists (sub-lists are processed, maintaining structure). The recursion's base cases are the scalar inputs handled in step 2.\n4.  **Error Handling**: If the input type is not one of the supported types, raise a `TypeError`.\n\nThis approach ensures that the output structure matches the input structure (rank-wise) and all numerical results are Python floats rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sigmoid_grad(z):\n    \"\"\"Return the derivative of the sigmoid function given its output.\n\n    The input *z* already contains sigmoid values (numbers in [0,1]).

This means the likelihood $P(\\mathbf{x} | c)$ can be written as the product of individual feature likelihoods:\n        $P(\\mathbf{x} | c) = \\prod_{j} P(x_j | c)$.\n    *   Each feature likelihood $P(x_j | c)$ is modeled by a Gaussian (Normal) distribution:\n        $P(x_j | c) = \\mathcal{N}(x_j \\mid \\mu_{cj}, \\sigma_{cj}^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma_{cj}}\\exp\\Bigl(\\!-\\,\\frac{(x_j-\\mu_{cj})^2}{2\\sigma_{cj}^2}\\Bigr)$.\n    *   To avoid numerical underflow (multiplying many small probabilities) and for computational convenience, we work with log-probabilities:\n        $\\log P(c | \\mathbf{x}) \\propto \\log P(c) + \\sum_{j} \\log P(x_j | c)$.\n        The log-likelihood for a single feature $x_j$ given class $c$ is:\n        $\\log P(x_j | c) = -\\log(\\sqrt{2\\pi}) - \\log(\\sigma_{cj}) - \\frac{(x_j-\\mu_{cj})^2}{2\\sigma_{cj}^2}$.\n    *   We calculate the log-posterior for class 0 and class 1 for each test sample.\n    *   The predicted class is the one with the higher log-posterior probability.\n\nThe implementation will use NumPy for efficient array operations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gaussian_naive_bayes(X_train: np.ndarray, y_train: np.ndarray, X_test: np.ndarray) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Gaussian Naive Bayes binary classifier.\n\n    Training phase: estimate mean, standard deviation and class prior for\n    every feature of both classes.\n    Prediction phase: compute the posterior probability for each class\n    using the Gaussian likelihood (with feature independence assumption)\n    and return the most probable class (0 or 1) for every test sample.\n\n    Args:\n        X_train: 2-D NumPy array of shape (n_samples, n_features) containing\n                  the training features.\n        y_train: 1-D NumPy array of length n_samples with binary labels\n                  (each entry is 0 or 1).\n        X_test:  2-D NumPy array of shape (m_samples, n_features) containing\n                  the data to classify.\n\n    Returns:\n        A Python list of length m_samples where each element is the\n        predicted class label (0 or 1).\n    \"\"\"\n    n_samples_train, n_features = X_train.shape\n    epsilon = 1e-9  # Small constant to add to standard deviations\n\n    # Parameters for 2 classes (0 and 1)\n    # means_params[c, f] = mean of feature f for class c\n    # stds_params[c, f] = std of feature f for class c (stores sigma, not sigma^2)\n    # priors_params[c] = prior of class c\n    means_params = np.zeros((2, n_features))\n    stds_params = np.zeros((2, n_features)) \n    priors_params = np.zeros(2)\n\n    # --- Training Phase ---\n    # The problem specifies binary labels (0 or 1).\n    classes = [0, 1]\n\n    for c in classes:\n        # Select samples belonging to the current class c\n        X_c = X_train[y_train == c]\n        n_c = X_c.shape[0]  # Number of samples in class c\n\n        if n_c == 0:\n            # This class is not present in the training data or has no samples.\n            # Its prior is 0.\n            priors_params[c] = 0.0\n            # Set placeholder means and stds.

{"task_id": 561, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the Expectation\u2013Maximization (EM) algorithm for a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), we will follow these main steps:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Initialize mixture weights (\u03c0_k) uniformly or randomly, ensuring they sum to 1.\n    *   Initialize means (\u03bc_k) by randomly selecting K data points from the input samples.\n    *   Initialize full covariance matrices (\u03a3_k). A common approach is to use the covariance of the entire dataset, or scaled identity matrices. We'll use a version of the global covariance (or scaled identity if global covariance is hard to estimate, e.g., N < D), regularized by adding a small multiple of the identity matrix (e.g., `reg_cov * I`) to ensure positive definiteness.\n    *   A fixed random seed will be used for initialization to ensure deterministic output for identical inputs, as requested.\n\n2.  **Expectation\u2013Maximization Iterations**:\n    *   Repeat for a `max_iter` number of iterations or until convergence:\n        *   **E-step (Expectation)**: For each data point `n` and each component `k`, calculate the responsibility `\u03b3_nk`. This is the posterior probability that point `x_n` belongs to component `k`.\n            `\u03b3_nk = (\u03c0_k * N(x_n | \u03bc_k, \u03a3_k)) / (\u03a3_{j=1 to K} \u03c0_j * N(x_n | \u03bc_j, \u03a3_j))`\n            where `N(x | \u03bc, \u03a3)` is the probability density function (PDF) of a multivariate Gaussian. We will implement a robust PDF calculation, typically by working with log-probabilities internally to avoid underflow/overflow, and then exponentiating.\n        *   **M-step (Maximization)**: Update the model parameters (weights, means, covariances) using the calculated responsibilities:\n            *   Effective number of points for component `k`: `N_k = \u03a3_n \u03b3_nk`. A small constant is added to `N_k` to prevent division by zero if a component becomes empty.\n            *   New weights: `\u03c0_k_new = N_k / N_total_effective_points` (where `N_total_effective_points` is sum of all `N_k`).\n            *   New means: `\u03bc_k_new = (1/N_k) * \u03a3_n \u03b3_nk * x_n`\n            *   New covariances: `\u03a3_k_new = (1/N_k) * \u03a3_n \u03b3_nk * (x_n - \u03bc_k_new) * (x_n - \u03bc_k_new)^T`. Regularization (`reg_cov * I`) is added here as well to maintain positive definiteness and numerical stability.\n        *   **Convergence Check**: The loop terminates if the maximum number of iterations (`max_iter`) is reached or if the maximum absolute change in mixture weights (`\u03c0_k`) between the current and previous iteration is less than a tolerance `epsilon`.\n\n3.  **Final Assignment**:\n    *   After the EM algorithm converges (or `max_iter` is reached), assign each data sample `x_n` to the Gaussian component `k` for which its responsibility `\u03b3_nk` (posterior probability) is highest. This requires one final E-step calculation using the converged parameters.\n\n4.  **Deterministic Output and Re-labelling**:\n    *   To ensure the output is deterministic and consistently labelled, the K Gaussian components are sorted based on the first coordinate of their means (\u03bc_k[0]) in ascending order.\n    *   The cluster labels (0 to K-1) are then re-assigned according to this sorted order. For example, the component whose mean has the smallest first coordinate becomes component 0, the next smallest becomes component 1, and so on.\n\n5.  **Special Case K=1**:\n    *   If `K=1`, all samples belong to the single component. The function will return a list of zeros of length N.\n\nNumerical stability is crucial:\n*   Covariance matrices are regularized to prevent singularity.\n*   PDF calculations handle potential underflow/overflow by working with log-probabilities where appropriate and ensuring denominators in responsibility calculations are not zero.\n*   Small constants are added to effective point counts (`N_k`) to prevent division by zero.\n\nThe implementation will be a self-contained Python script using NumPy for numerical operations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef _gmm_multivariate_gaussian_pdf(X: np.ndarray, \n                                   mean: np.ndarray, \n                                   cov: np.ndarray, \n                                   D: int,\n                                   min_pdf_val: float = 1e-300) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function to compute Multivariate Gaussian PDF values.\n    Uses log-probabilities for numerical stability.\n\n    Args:\n        X (np.ndarray): Data points, shape (N, D).\n        mean (np.ndarray): Mean of the Gaussian component, shape (D,).\n        cov (np.ndarray): Covariance matrix of the Gaussian component, shape (D, D).\n        D (int): Number of features/dimensions.\n        min_pdf_val (float): Minimum value for PDF if calculation results in issues.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: PDF values for each data point, shape (N,).\n    \"\"\"\n    N = X.shape[0]\n    mean_reshaped = mean.reshape(1, D) # Ensure mean is (1,D) for broadcasting\n\n    try:\n        sign, log_det_cov = np.linalg.slogdet(cov)\n        if sign <= 0: # Determinant is not positive (singular or ill-conditioned)\n            return np.full(N, min_pdf_val, dtype=np.float64)\n        \n        inv_cov = np.linalg.inv(cov)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        # Fallback if inversion or slogdet fails despite regularization in M-step\n        return np.full(N, min_pdf_val, dtype=np.float64)\n\n    # Log of normalization constant part: -0.5 * (D * log(2*pi) + log_det_cov)\n    log_norm_const_part = -0.5 * (D * np.log(2 * np.pi) + log_det_cov)\n    \n    X_minus_mean = X - mean_reshaped # (N, D)\n    \n    # Mahalanobis distance squared: (X - mean)^T @ inv_cov @ (X - mean)\n    # Efficiently: np.einsum('ni,ij,nj->n', X_minus_mean, inv_cov, X_minus_mean)\n    try:\n        mahalanobis_sq = np.einsum('ni,ij,nj->n', X_minus_mean, inv_cov, X_minus_mean)\n    except ValueError: # Should not happen with correct dimensions\n        return np.full(N, min_pdf_val, dtype=np.float64)\n\n    log_pdf = log_norm_const_part - 0.5 * mahalanobis_sq # (N,)\n    \n    pdf_values = np.exp(log_pdf)\n    \n    # Handle potential NaNs or Infs from np.exp, though log-domain math reduces this.\n    # If pdf_values are inf, it might be due to det_cov being extremely small.\n    pdf_values = np.nan_to_num(pdf_values, nan=min_pdf_val, \n                               posinf=np.finfo(np.float64).max, neginf=min_pdf_val)\n    pdf_values = np.maximum(pdf_values, min_pdf_val) # Ensure non-negative and non-zero\n\n    return pdf_values\n\ndef gmm_em(data: np.ndarray, k: int, max_iter: int = 200, epsilon: float = 1e-4) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).\n\n    Args:\n        data (np.ndarray): A 2-D NumPy array of shape (N, D) containing N samples\n                           with D features.\n        k (int): The number of Gaussian components (clusters).\n        max_iter (int, optional): The maximum number of EM iterations.

The solution proceeds under this assumption; behavior for `N < n_cluster` (when `n_cluster > 1`) is not explicitly defined by the problem for certain steps.\n\n2.  **Build Similarity Graph (Adjacency Matrix `W`)**:\n    *   Calculate pairwise squared Euclidean distances between all data points. The squared distance $\\|x_i - x_j\\|^2$ can be computed efficiently using the identity $\\|x_i - x_j\\|^2 = \\|x_i\\|^2 + \\|x_j\\|^2 - 2 x_i^T x_j$.\n    *   Apply the Gaussian (RBF) kernel to these distances to get the similarity matrix `W`: $w_{ij} = \\exp(-\\gamma \\|x_i - x_j\\|^2)$.

(This step implies `N >= n_cluster`).\n    *   If the `'normalized'` method was chosen, row-normalize the matrix `U`. Each row $u_i$ of $U$ is replaced by $u_i / \\|u_i\\|_2$. Rows with a norm of zero remain zero.\n\n5.  **K-means Clustering**:\n    *   Perform k-means clustering on the rows of matrix `U`. Each row of `U` is treated as a point in an `n_cluster`-dimensional space.\n    *   The number of clusters for k-means is `n_cluster`.\n    *   **Deterministic K-means Initialization**: The first `n_cluster` rows of `U` are chosen as the initial centroids. (This also implies `N >= n_cluster`).\n    *   **K-means Iteration**:\n        *   Assignment Step: Assign each point (row of `U`) to the cluster whose centroid is closest (Euclidean distance).\n        *   Update Step: Recalculate each centroid as the mean of all points assigned to its cluster. If a cluster becomes empty, its centroid remains unchanged (this ensures determinism).\n        *   Repeat until convergence (i.e., cluster assignments no longer change) or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n    *   The output of k-means is a list of cluster labels for the `N` points.\n\n6.  **Relabel Clusters**:\n    *   The k-means labels need to be remapped according to the specified rule: \"the cluster containing the smallest original index gets label 0, the next one 1, etc.\"\n    *   Iterate through the original data samples by their index `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\n    *   If sample `i` belongs to a k-means cluster (say, `k_label`) that hasn't been assigned a new final label yet, then all samples belonging to `k_label` are assigned the next available final label (starting from 0). Mark `k_label` as processed. Increment the final label counter.\n    *   Continue until all `n_cluster` final labels are assigned or all samples are processed.\n\n7.  **Return Labels**: The final remapped labels are returned as a Python list.\n\nA helper function `_kmeans` is implemented for the k-means part.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _kmeans(X: np.ndarray, n_clusters: int, initial_centroid_indices: list[int], max_iter: int = 300) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs K-means clustering.\n    Args:\n        X: Data points, shape (N, d_features).\n        n_clusters: Number of clusters.\n        initial_centroid_indices: List of indices in X to use as initial centroids.\n                                  It's assumed len(initial_centroid_indices) == n_clusters\n                                  and max(initial_centroid_indices) < X.shape[0].\n        max_iter: Maximum number of iterations.\n    Returns:\n        labels: Cluster labels for each point, shape (N,).\n        centroids: Final centroids, shape (n_clusters, d_features).\n    \"\"\"\n    N, d_features = X.shape\n    \n    if N == 0:\n        # No points to cluster, return empty labels and centroids\n        # Handle X.shape = (0,0) for d_features\n        return np.array([], dtype=int), np.array([]).reshape(0, d_features if d_features > 0 else 0) \n    \n    if n_clusters == 0: # No clusters to form\n        return np.zeros(N, dtype=int), np.array([]).reshape(0, d_features if d_features > 0 else 0)\n\n    # Initialize centroids using the specified indices from X\n    centroids = X[initial_centroid_indices, :].copy() # Use .copy() to avoid modifying U if X is U\n    \n    labels = np.full(N, -1, dtype=int) # Initialize with a value that's not a valid label\n    \n    for _iteration in range(max_iter):\n        # Assignment step: Assign each point to the nearest centroid\n        distances_sq = np.zeros((N, n_clusters))\n        for i in range(n_clusters):\n            diff = X - centroids[i, :] # Broadcasting: (N, d_features) - (d_features,) -> (N, d_features)\n            distances_sq[:, i] = np.sum(diff**2, axis=1) # Sum along feature dimension\n        \n        new_labels = np.argmin(distances_sq, axis=1)\n        \n        # Check for convergence: if labels haven't changed, stop\n        if np.array_equal(new_labels, labels):\n            break\n        labels = new_labels\n        \n        # Update step: Recalculate centroids as the mean of points in each cluster\n        new_centroids = np.zeros((n_clusters, d_features))\n        for i in range(n_clusters):\n            cluster_points = X[labels == i]\n            if len(cluster_points) > 0:\n                new_centroids[i, :] = np.mean(cluster_points, axis=0)\n            else:\n                # Handle empty cluster: keep the old centroid (deterministic behavior)\n                new_centroids[i, :] = centroids[i, :]\n        centroids = new_centroids\n        \n    return labels, centroids\n\ndef spectral_clustering(data: np.ndarray, n_cluster: int, gamma: float = 2.0, method: str = 'unnormalized') -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Perform spectral clustering on the given dataset.\n\n    Args:\n        data: A NumPy array of shape (N, d) containing N samples with d features.\n        n_cluster: The number of clusters to form.\n        gamma: The gamma parameter of the Gaussian (RBF) kernel used to build the similarity graph.\n        method: Either 'unnormalized' or 'normalized' \u2013 specifies which Laplacian variant to use.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of length N where the i-th element is an integer label identifying the\n        cluster assignment of the i-th sample (labels are 0-based).\n    \"\"\"\n    N, _ = data.shape\n\n    # Handle trivial cases\n    if n_cluster == 1:\n        return [0] * N\n    \n    if N == 0: # No data points\n        return []\n\n    if n_cluster <= 0: # Invalid number of clusters\n        raise ValueError(\"Number of clusters must be positive.\")\n    \n    # Note: The problem implies N >= n_cluster for n_cluster > 1 due to:\n    # 1.

{"task_id": 563, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the Dual-form Perceptron learning algorithm, we will follow the steps outlined in the problem description precisely.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**:\n    *   Initialize `alpha` as a NumPy array of zeros with length `N` (number of samples). `alpha` stores the coefficients for each training example.\n    *   Initialize bias `b` to 0.0.\n\n2.  **Gram Matrix Construction**:\n    *   Compute the Gram matrix `G` of size `N \u00d7 N`. Each element `G[i, j]` is the dot product of the `i`-th training sample `X_data[i]` and the `j`-th training sample `X_data[j]`. This can be efficiently calculated as `G = X_data @ X_data.T`.\n\n3.  **Iterative Updates**:\n    *   Repeat for a maximum of `max_iter` passes over the entire training set.\n    *   In each pass, iterate through all training samples `i` from `0` to `N-1`.\n        *   A flag `updated_in_this_pass` is used to track if any `alpha` or `b` values were modified during the current pass. It's reset to `False` at the start of each pass.\n        *   For each sample `i`, calculate the intermediate value `g = \u03a3\u2c7c \u03b1\u2c7c y\u2c7c G[j, i]`. This sum is over all samples `j`. `G[j, i]` refers to the element in the `j`-th row and `i`-th column of the Gram matrix. This calculation can be vectorized as `np.dot(alpha * y_data, G[:, i])`, where `G[:, i]` is the `i`-th column of `G`.\n        *   Check the perceptron condition: if `y_data[i] * (g + b) \u2264 0`, the current model misclassifies sample `i` or classifies it with zero margin.\n            *   If the condition is met, update `alpha[i]` by adding `eta` (`\u03b1\u1d62 \u2190 \u03b1\u1d62 + \u03b7`).\n            *   Update `b` by adding `eta * y_data[i]` (`b \u2190 b + \u03b7 y\u1d62`).\n            *   Set `updated_in_this_pass` to `True`.\n    *   After iterating through all samples in a pass, if `updated_in_this_pass` is still `False`, it means no updates were made in the entire pass, so the algorithm has converged. The loop can be terminated early.\n    *   If `max_iter` is reached and the algorithm hasn't converged, the loop terminates, and the current `alpha` and `b` values are used.\n\n4.  **Weight Vector Recovery**:\n    *   After the loop finishes (either by convergence or reaching `max_iter`), the primal weight vector `w` is recovered using the formula `w = \u03a3\u1d62 \u03b1\u1d62 y\u1d62 x\u1d62`.

{"task_id": 564, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this task, we need to implement the `predict_sample` function that traverses a decision tree, represented by `Node` objects, to find a prediction for a given sample. The traversal logic depends on whether the tree is for 'classification' or 'regression'. We also need a definition for the `Node` class that aligns with the problem description.\n\n**Node Class Definition:**\nThe `Node` class will serve as a structure to hold information for each node in the tree. Based on the problem description, a `Node` instance can have attributes like `label`, `x`, `s`, `y`, and `child`. We'll define a simple class, and its attributes will be set dynamically as if by a tree-learning algorithm.\n\n- Leaf nodes will have a `y` attribute storing the prediction.\n- Internal nodes will have a `label` attribute (feature index) and a `child` attribute (list of children).\n  - For regression trees, internal nodes also have an `s` attribute (split-point).\n  - For classification trees, the children of an internal node will each have an `x` attribute representing the feature value that leads to them.\n\n**`predict_sample` Function Logic:**\nThe function will be recursive.\n\n1.  **Base Case**: If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has a `y` attribute), return `node.y`.\n2.  **Recursive Step**: If the current node is an internal node:\n    *   **For `task_type == 'classification'`**:\n        1.  Get the feature index from `node.label`.\n        2.  Get the corresponding feature value from the input `features`.\n        3.  Iterate through `node.child`. If a `child_node` is found such that `child_node.x` equals the feature value, this `child_node` becomes the next node to visit.\n        4.  If no such child is found after checking all children, the next node to visit is `node.child[1]` (the second child), as per the default rule.\n        5.  Recursively call `predict_sample` with the chosen next node.\n    *   **For `task_type == 'regression'`**:\n        1.  Get the feature index from `node.label` and the split-point from `node.s`.\n        2.  Get the corresponding feature value from the input `features`.\n        3.

Recursively call `predict_sample` with the chosen next node.\n\nThe implementation assumes the tree is \"well-formed\" as stated, meaning attributes like `label`, `s`, `x`, and `child` will be present where expected, and list indices (e.g., `node.child[1]`) will be valid when accessed according to the rules.\n\n```python\n# Definition of Node class\n# This is a helper class as described in the problem.\n# Instances of this class are expected to be populated by a decision-tree learning algorithm.\nclass Node:\n    \"\"\"\n    A node in a decision tree.\n\n    Attributes that a Node instance *can* store:\n    - y: The prediction value if the node is a leaf (class label or real number).\n    - label: An integer index of the feature to inspect (if an internal node).\n    - child: A list of children nodes (if an internal node).\n             For regression, this list has 2 children.\n             For classification, this list has 1 or more children.\n    - s: A numerical split-point (if an internal regression node).\n    - x: The value associated with the edge leading from the parent to this\n         node (if a child in a classification tree branch).\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes a Node.

{"task_id": 565, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To select the feature that maximizes information gain for the ID3 algorithm, we need to implement the following steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate Overall Entropy H(y)**: First, compute the entropy of the entire set of class labels `y`. Entropy measures the impurity or disorder of a set of labels. It's calculated as:\n    `H(S) = - sum_{c in C} p(c) * log2(p(c))`\n    where `C` is the set of unique classes, and `p(c)` is the proportion of samples belonging to class `c`. A helper function `_calculate_entropy(labels)` will be used for this. This function handles empty sets (entropy 0) and cases where `p(c) = 0` (term `0 * log2(0)` is taken as 0).\n\n2.  **Handle Edge Cases**:\n    *   If there are no features (`n_features == 0`), return `(-1, 0.0)` as no feature can be selected.\n    *   If there are no samples (`n_samples == 0`), the entropy of `y` is 0. Information gain for any feature will be 0. We can return the first feature index (0) with 0.0 gain.\n    *   If the initial entropy `H(y)` is 0 (i.e., all samples belong to the same class), then no feature can improve purity. All information gains will be 0. In this case, return the first feature index (0) with 0.0 gain, adhering to the tie-breaking rule.\n\n3.  **Iterate Through Features**: For each feature (column in `X`):\n    *   **Calculate Conditional Entropy H(y|A)**: For a feature `A`, the conditional entropy `H(y|A)` is calculated. This is the weighted average of entropies of subsets of `y`, where each subset corresponds to a unique value of feature `A`.\n        `H(y|A) = sum_{v in Values(A)} (P(A=v) * H(y | A=v))`\n        where `Values(A)` are the unique values of feature `A`, `P(A=v)` is the proportion of samples where feature `A` has value `v`, and `H(y | A=v)` is the entropy of labels for that subset of samples.\n    *   **Calculate Information Gain IG(A)**: The information gain for feature `A` is:\n        `IG(A) = H(y) - H(y|A)`\n\n4.  **Select Best Feature**:\n    *   Keep track of the `max_info_gain` found so far and the `best_feature_index`.\n    *   Initialize `max_info_gain` to a value lower than any possible information gain (e.g., -1.0, since IG >= 0).\n    *   Initialize `best_feature_index` to 0 (the first feature).\n    *   If `current_info_gain` for a feature is strictly greater than `max_info_gain`, update `max_info_gain` and `best_feature_index`. This handles the tie-breaking rule: if multiple features have the same maximal gain, the one with the smallest index (encountered first) will be retained.\n\n5.  **Format Output**:\n    *   Before returning, ensure `max_info_gain` is not negative due to floating-point inaccuracies (clamp to 0.0 if it's slightly negative).\n    *   Round the `max_info_gain` to 6 decimal places.\n    *   Handle the case where rounding might produce `-0.0`; convert it to `0.0`.\n    *   Return the tuple `(best_feature_index, final_max_info_gain)`.\n\nThe implementation uses `numpy` for efficient array operations and `math.log2` for logarithm calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\n# It's good practice to put helper functions (like _calculate_entropy)\n# either inside the main function if they are only used there and capture\n# variables, or outside (as done here) if they are general utilities.\n# Making it a private helper (_calculate_entropy) is a good convention.\n\ndef _calculate_entropy(labels: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Helper function to calculate entropy of a set of labels.\n    Entropy H(S) = - sum_{c in C} p(c) * log2(p(c))\n    \"\"\"\n    if labels.size == 0:\n        return 0.0  # Entropy of an empty set is 0\n\n    # Find unique labels and their counts\n    # np.unique also sorts the unique labels, but order doesn't matter for entropy\n    _, counts = np.unique(labels, return_counts=True)\n    \n    # Calculate probabilities of each class\n    probabilities = counts / labels.size\n    \n    entropy = 0.0\n    for p in probabilities:\n        if p > 0:  # This check avoids math.log2(0) which is undefined.\n                   # The term p * log2(p) is 0 if p is 0.\n            entropy -= p * math.log2(p)\n    return entropy\n\ndef choose_best_feature(X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> tuple[int, float]:\n    \"\"\"Return the feature index that yields maximal information gain.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X : np.ndarray\n        2-D array of shape (n_samples, n_features) containing discrete feature\n        values encoded as non-negative integers starting from 0.\n    y : np.ndarray\n        1-D array of shape (n_samples,) containing integer class labels\n        starting from 0.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple[int, float]\n        A tuple consisting of the index of the best feature and the maximum\n        information gain rounded to 6 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n\n    # Edge case: No features to select from.\n    # The problem implies \"select the feature\", so n_features >= 1 is assumed.\n    # If n_features can be 0, this is a way to handle it.\n    if n_features == 0:\n        return (-1, 0.0) # Or raise ValueError, as per specific requirements.\n\n    # Edge case: No samples.\n    if n_samples == 0:\n        # No data to learn from.

{"task_id": 568, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "The Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) classifier models the conditional probability `P(y|x)` as:\n`P(y|x) = (1 / Z(x)) * exp( \u03a3_j w_j * f_j(x,y) )`\nwhere `f_j(x,y)` are binary features indicating the presence of a specific `(feature_index, feature_value, label)` tuple, `w_j` are the weights to be learned, and `Z(x)` is the normalization constant (partition function): `Z(x) = \u03a3_y' exp( \u03a3_j w_j * f_j(x,y') )`.\n\nThe Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS) algorithm is used to find the weights `w_j` that maximize the likelihood of the training data. GIS iteratively updates the weights based on the difference between the empirical expectation of features (observed in data) and the model's expectation of features.\n\nThe core steps are:\n1.  **Feature Definition**: Identify all unique features `f_j`. Each feature `j` corresponds to a tuple `(column_index, value_in_column, label)`. A feature `f_j(x,y)` is 1 if `x` has `value_in_column` at `column_index` AND the class is `label`; otherwise, it's 0.\n2.  **Empirical Distribution**: Calculate the empirical expectation for each feature `f_j`: `E_tilde[f_j] = (1/N) * \u03a3_i f_j(x_i, y_i)`, where `(x_i, y_i)` are training samples and `N` is the total number of training samples. This is the observed frequency of the feature being active with the true label in the training data.\n3.  **Iterative Weight Update (GIS)**:\n    *   Initialize weights `w_j` (e.g., to 0).\n    *   In each iteration `t`:\n        *   Calculate the model's expectation for each feature `f_j`:\n            `E_model[f_j] = \u03a3_i (1/N) * \u03a3_y P(y|x_i, w^(t)) * f_j(x_i, y)`.\n        *   Update the weights using the GIS rule:\n            `w_j^(t+1) = w_j^(t) + (1/C) * log( E_tilde[f_j] / E_model[f_j] )`.\n            `C` is a constant, typically `\u03a3_j f_j(x,y)`, which must be the same for all `(x,y)` pairs for standard GIS. For our feature definition, `C` is the number of columns in `X` (i.e., `X_train.shape[1]`), as for any `(x,y)`, exactly `X_train.shape[1]` features of the form `(column_idx, x[column_idx], y)` are active.\n        *   To handle `log(0)` or division by zero, small smoothing constants are added to the numerator and denominator of the ratio.\n    *   Repeat until convergence (change in weights is less than `epsilon`) or `n_iter` is reached.\n4.  **Prediction**: For a test sample `x_test`, calculate the score `S(y) = \u03a3_j w_j * f_j(x_test, y)` for each possible label `y`. Predict the label `y` that maximizes `S(y)` (which also maximizes `P(y|x_test)`).\n\nThe implementation handles edge cases such as empty training/test data, data with no features, or no variation in labels. Softmax stabilization (subtracting the maximum score before exponentiation) is used during the calculation of `P(y|x)` to prevent numerical overflow/underflow.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef maxent_predict(\n    X_train: np.ndarray,\n    y_train: np.ndarray,\n    X_test: np.ndarray,\n    epsilon: float = 1e-3,\n    n_iter: int = 100,\n) -> list[int]:\n    \n    num_samples_train = X_train.shape[0]\n\n    # Handle empty test set first\n    if X_test.shape[0] == 0:\n        return []\n\n    # Handle empty training set\n    if num_samples_train == 0:\n        # No training data.

The term $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\odot \\mathbf{y}$ denotes the element-wise product of $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$.\n    In NumPy, if `X`, `y`, and `alpha` are NumPy arrays, this can be computed as:\n    `alpha_y = alpha * y` (element-wise product)\n    `w = X.T @ alpha_y` (matrix multiplication of $X^\\top$ and `alpha_y`)\n    The resulting `w` will be a 1D NumPy array of shape (d,).\n\n2.  **Bias $b$**:\n    $\\displaystyle b = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\bigl(y\\_i-\\mathbf w^{\\top}\\mathbf x\\_i\\bigr)$\n    Here, $n$ is the number of training samples.

{"task_id": 572, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm from scratch, we will follow the five core steps outlined in the problem description. We'll use NumPy for numerical operations, adhering to the constraint of not using higher-level libraries like `scipy` or `sklearn` for the core LOF logic.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Compute Pair-wise Euclidean Distances:**\n    We'll calculate the Euclidean distance between all pairs of samples. A common vectorized method is `dist(x,y)^2 = ||x||^2 + ||y||^2 - 2 * x^T y`. We take the square root of this, ensuring non-negativity due to potential floating-point inaccuracies.\n\n2.  **Determine k-distance and k-Nearest Neighbors (N<sub>k</sub>(p)):**\n    For each sample `p`:\n    *   Sort its distances to all other samples.\n    *   The *k-distance* of `p` is the distance to its *k*-th nearest neighbor (the `k`-th element in the sorted list of distances, excluding the distance to `p` itself, which is 0).\n    *   *N<sub>k</sub>(p)* is the set of indices of these *k* nearest neighbors.\n\n3.  **Calculate Reachability Distance (reach-dist<sub>k</sub>(p,q)):**\n    This is defined as `max(k-distance(q), dist(p,q))`. It represents how \"reachable\" `q` is from `p`, considering the local density around `q`. If `p` is far from `q`, it's simply `dist(p,q)`. If `p` is very close to `q` (closer than `q`'s *k*-th neighbor), the distance is \"smoothed\" to `k-distance(q)`.\n\n4.  **Compute Local Reachability Density (LRD<sub>k</sub>(p)):**\n    LRD of `p` is `k / \u03a3_{q\u2208N_k(p)} reach-dist_k(p,q)`. It's inversely proportional to the average reachability distance from `p` to its neighbors. A high LRD means `p` is in a dense region.\n    *   To handle cases where the sum of reachability distances is zero (e.g., if `p` and all its `k` neighbors are identical points and their *k-distances* are also zero), we add a small epsilon to the denominator to prevent division by zero and ensure LRD becomes very large (approximating infinity), which is the correct behavior.\n\n5.  **Calculate Local Outlier Factor (LOF<sub>k</sub>(p)):**\n    LOF of `p` is `( (\u03a3_{q\u2208N_k(p)} LRD_k(q)) / k ) / LRD_k(p)`. This is the ratio of the average LRD of `p`'s neighbors to the LRD of `p` itself.\n    *   If `LOF_k(p)` is close to 1, `p` has a similar density to its neighbors (inlier).\n    *   If `LOF_k(p)` is significantly larger than 1, `p` is in a sparser region than its neighbors (outlier).\n    *   If `LOF_k(p)` is significantly smaller than 1, `p` is in a denser region than its neighbors (inlier, part of a dense cluster).\n    *   The LRD values calculated in step 4 (with the epsilon adjustment) ensure that `LRD_k(p)` is positive, making the division safe. If `p` and its neighbors are part of a very dense, identical cluster, their LRDs will all be very large, and LOF will be approximately 1.\n\n**Output:**\nThe function will return a tuple:\n*   A list of LOF scores for all samples, rounded to four decimal places.\n*   An ascending list of indices for samples whose LOF score is strictly greater than the given `epsilon`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef local_outlier_factor(data: np.ndarray, k: int, epsilon: float = 1.5):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for each sample in the dataset.\n\n    Args:\n        data (np.ndarray): The input data, where rows are samples and columns are features.\n        k (int): The number of nearest neighbors to consider.
