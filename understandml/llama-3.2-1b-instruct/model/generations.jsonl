We first check if the matrix `X` is invertible by computing its determinant. If the determinant is zero, we return `-1`.\n2. We compute the weight vector `w` using the formula for Ridge Regression Closed-Form Solver.\n3. We use `np.linalg.inv` to compute the inverse of the matrix `X_tX + alpha * np.eye(X.shape[1])`, which is the matrix that we need to invert.\n4. We compute the dot product of `X_tX` and `X_t_y` to get the weighted sum of the data points.\n5. We compute the dot product of `X` and `data` to get the weighted sum of the features.\n6. We round the weight vector `w` to 4 decimal places using `np.round`.\n7. Finally, we return the weight vector as a list.\n\nYou can test the function with an example:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndata = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\nalpha = 0.1\nw = ridge_regression(data, alpha)\nprint(w)\n```\nThis should output the weight vector rounded to 4 decimal places."}

Compute the activation of the current sample by summing the product of the current weights, the current sample, and the labels.\n4. Check if the sample is misclassified by comparing the activation with the threshold (i.e., the sum of the weights and bias). If the sample is misclassified, update the weights and bias by adding the product of the learning rate and the difference between the activation and the threshold.\n5. If the sample is correctly classified, break the loop after the first iteration.\n6. Round the weights and bias to 4 decimal places before returning the final values.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input data is a NumPy array of shape `(n_samples, n_features)`, where `n_samples` is the number of samples and `n_features` is the number of features.

We initialize an empty dictionary `result` to store the frequent itemsets and their support counts.\n2. We iterate over all possible itemsets using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over all possible sizes of itemsets (from 1 to the length of the first transaction), and the inner loop generates all combinations of itemsets of that size.\n3. For each itemset, we calculate its support by counting the number of transactions that contain it. We use the `set` function to get the intersection of the itemset and the transaction, and then use the `sum` function to count the number of elements in the resulting set.\n4. We check if the support is greater than or equal to the minimum support. If it is, we add the itemset and its support to the result dictionary.\n5. Finally, we return the result dictionary.\n\nNote that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2 * 2^n), where n is the number of transactions. This is because we need to generate all possible combinations of itemsets and check their support for each itemset.

Note that we use `(-z)` instead of `(-z)` to avoid a syntax error.\n\nThe `if np.issubdtype(z, np.floating)` check is necessary because the `sigmoid` function is not defined for non-numeric inputs. By checking if `z` is a floating-point number, we can ensure that the function is called correctly.\n\nThe code also uses NumPy's `exp` function to compute the exponential term in the sigmoid formula, which is more efficient than computing it manually.\n\nFinally, we use the `tolist()` method to convert the final NumPy array back to a Python list if it's an array-like input."}

We then apply the Leaky ReLU function to each element in the array using `np.where`. The condition `z >= 0` checks if the element is non-negative, and if so, it returns the element as is. Otherwise, it returns `a * z`, which is the Leaky ReLU activation.\n3.

It returns a list of predicted labels for the test data.\n\nThe function initializes the ensemble with the first decision stump and trains it for `n_clf` rounds. In each round, it chooses the stump that minimizes the weighted classification error and updates the ensemble with the chosen stump. Finally, it predicts the labels for the test data by computing the weighted sum of stump decisions and determining the predicted label based on the weighted sum.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the decision stumps are one-level decision trees, where each feature is a binary variable. The `feature_index`, `threshold`, and `polarity` variables represent the column in the training data, the value that splits the data, and the polarity of the stump, respectively."}

We first get the indices of the top `retain_prcnt` fraction of the samples using `np.argsort(rewards)[-retain_prcnt * len(theta_samples):]`. This selects the indices of the top `retain_prcnt` fraction of the samples in the `theta_samples` array.\n2. We then select the top `retain_prcnt` fraction of the samples using slicing (`idx = ...`). This creates a new array `theta_samples` containing only the retained samples.\n3. We compute the mean and variance of the retained samples using `np.mean` and `np.var`, respectively. We use `axis=0` to compute the mean along the rows (i.e., for each sample).\n4. We round the results to four decimal places using `np.round`.\n5. Finally, we return the mean and variance as two lists, rounded to four decimal places.\n\nNote that we use `retain_prcnt * len(theta_samples)` to decide how many samples to retain, as specified in the problem statement. If `retain_prcnt * len(theta_samples)` is not an integer, we use `int(retain_prcnt * len(theta_samples))` to round down to the nearest integer."}

It starts by initializing the cluster labels and the list of clusters. Then, it iterates over each sample, checking if it is a core point or a neighbor of a core point. If it is a core point, it adds it to the first cluster. If not, it checks for neighbors and adds them to the current cluster if they are core points. Finally, it checks if the cluster has at least `min_samples` points and adds it to the list of clusters if it does.\n\nThe `is_core_point` function checks if a point is within the neighborhood of another point by calculating the Euclidean distance between them. If the distance is greater than the threshold `eps`, the point is not considered a core point.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input data is a 2D NumPy array with shape `(n_samples, n_features)`, where `n_samples` is the number of samples and `n_features` is the number of features. The `eps` parameter is the maximum radius of the neighborhood to be considered reachable, and the `min_samples` parameter is the minimum number of points required to form a dense region."}

Initialize a dictionary `word_freq` to store word frequencies.\n2. Initialize a list `ratios` to store the document-frequency ratios.\n3. Iterate over each document in the `data` list, and for each document:\n\t* Iterate over each word in the document.\n\t* Increment the word frequency in the `word_freq` dictionary.\n\t* Calculate the document-frequency ratio for each word.\n\t* Append the ratio to the `ratios` list.\n4. Sort the `ratios` list in descending order.\n5. If `cut_off` is `None`, return the entire `ratios` list as a tuple.\n6. Otherwise, return the top `cut_off` elements of the `ratios` list as a tuple and a set containing those elements.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input `data` list is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a label and a list of words. The `cut_off` parameter is an integer or `None`, and the function returns a tuple containing two lists: the first list contains tuples of the form `(word, ratio)`, and the second list contains the top `cut_off` elements of the first list."}

We initialize the centroids with the first `k` samples in `X`.\n2. We iterate for at most `max_iters` iterations.\n3. In each iteration, we assign each sample to the nearest centroid using the squared Euclidean distance.\n4. We update the centroids to the mean of the samples assigned to each centroid.\n5. We check for convergence by checking if all centroids are equal. If they are, we break the loop.\n6. We sort the centroids in ascending lexicographical order.\n7. We round the centroids to 4 decimal places.\n8. Finally, we return the sorted centroids.\n\nYou can test this function with an example:\n```python\nX = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\nk = 2\ncentroids = kmeans_centroids(X, k)\nprint(centroids)\n```\nThis should output the centroids of the K-Means clustering with `k=2` and `X=[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`."}
