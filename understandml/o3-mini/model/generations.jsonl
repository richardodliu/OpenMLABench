The minimum (down) and maximum (up) values among the samples for this feature are computed.\n   - A random split value v is drawn uniformly from [down, up].\n   - Samples are partitioned into left (feature value \u2264 v) and right (feature value > v) and build_tree is recursively called for each branch with depth increased by 1.\n3. Finally, the list depths is returned where each entry corresponds to the depth of that sample in the isolation tree.\n\nThis implementation meets the task requirements and reproduces the example output when using the provided test case."}

If an item meets or exceeds the threshold, it is added as a frequent itemset (represented as a frozenset internally and a sorted tuple in the result).\n3. Candidate Generation: For k > 1, candidates are generated by taking the union of two frequent (k\u20111)-itemsets that differ by one element.

Preprocessing:\n   We first count the occurrences of every item in the transactions using a Counter.\n   Infrequent items (those with support less than min_support) are discarded.\n   \n2. FP-tree Construction:\n   We define a Node class for the FP-tree.\n   Each transaction is filtered (keeping only frequent items) and then sorted by descending frequency\n   (with lexicographic tie\u2010breaking) so that the tree is built in a deterministic manner.\n   \n3. FP-growth Mining:\n   The recursive function mine_tree \u201cmines\u201d the FP-tree:\n     \u2022 If the tree is a single-path it simply computes all combinations of items in that path, and\n       adds them (combined with the current prefix \u201cbase_pattern\u201d) to the result.\n     \u2022 Otherwise, for each item in the header table (in lexicographic order) it computes the\n       conditional pattern base and builds a conditional FP-tree. It then mines that tree recursively.\n  \n4. Output:\n   The frequent patterns are stored as tuples in a set (to avoid duplicates) and then converted to a list\n   of lists. The inner lists are sorted lexicographically and finally the outer list is sorted\n   by (length, lexicographic order) as required.\n   \nNote:\nThe support counts are used only for ensuring that frequent items appear in the FP-tree,\nand the result is simply all the frequent item-sets, not their supports.\n  \nThis implementation meets the stated output constraints and provides a clear FP-Growth solution.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nHappy coding!"}

For the final layer L, we compute the linear step and then apply the sigmoid activation.\n3. For each layer, we store the cache as a tuple of (A_prev, W, b, Z).\n4. The final activation matrix AL is rounded to 4 decimals and converted to a Python list via .tolist() before returning.\n5. Finally, we return the tuple (AL_rounded, caches).\n\nThis solution meets the task requirements."}

We initialize the weights w to be uniform.\n2. In each boosting iteration we loop over every feature, then over candidate thresholds (mid\u2013points between unique sorted values), and for each try both polarity = 1 and polarity = \u20131.\n3. We compute the weighted error for the stump and record the best stump.\n4. We compute the stump weight alpha from the weighted error.\n5. We update the weights w using the exponential update rule.\n6. After all classifiers are built, we predict each test sample by taking a weighted vote and returning the sign (defaulting to 1 in the case of 0).\n\nThis solution meets the task requirements by implementing AdaBoost with decision stumps from scratch and returning predictions as a Python list of labels (-1 or 1)."}

We augment the design matrix X with a column of ones (if intercept is to be fitted) or zeros (if not). This ensures the intercept is always stored in the first weight (and not penalised).\n2. In each iteration, when fitting an intercept, we recompute it as the mean of the residuals (y - contribution from features).\n3. For each weight (excluding the intercept), we temporarily set it to 0, compute the partial residual r_j, then update the weight using the soft-thresholding operator S(a, tau) divided by the squared norm of that feature.\n4. Finally we return the weights (for the original n features) as a list of rounded floats and the bias as a rounded float.\n\nThis implementation only uses NumPy and adheres to the coordinate descent algorithm described."}

It stops when either all data points in the node share the same label, the maximum depth is reached, or if a split fails (empty branch).\n4.

The function starts by initializing the medoids as the first k samples.\n2. It defines a helper function total_cost() that computes the sum of Euclidean distances\n   from every sample to its closest medoid.\n3. The algorithm then iterates over all possible swaps of one medoid and one non-medoid.\n   It selects the swap that gives the largest strict reduction in the cost if any.\n4. Once convergence is reached (i.e. no swap can reduce the cost further),\n   every sample is assigned to its closest medoid. In the event of ties, the medoid that\n   appears first in the current medoid list is chosen.\n5. Finally, the function returns the cluster labels as a list of integers.\n"}

We immediately return None if param_name is \"X\" or \"y\".\n2. For \"Ba\" or \"Bx\", we use the lower-case versions as the keys in the parameters dictionary.\n3. For each element in the chosen parameter array, we perturb by +epsilon and \u2212epsilon. For each of these new values, we run the forward loop for n\u209c time\u2013steps. Here it is assumed that at each time\u2013step, the input is the slice X[:, :, t] (converted to float64 for numerical stability).\n4. Finally, we compute the derivative using the centered difference formula and store each gradient at the same index. In the end, we return the transpose of the gradient array.\n   \nThis solution should meet the requirements noted in your task description."}

We define an auxiliary function entropy which computes the Shannon entropy of a list of labels.\n2. In best_split we first compute the overall entropy (parent_entropy) of the target labels.\n3. We prepare the data as (feature, label) pairs sorted by the feature values.\n4. We then scan the sorted list updating the left split counts and only consider candidate thresholds where consecutive feature values differ. The candidate threshold is the average of the two adjacent, distinct values.\n5. For each candidate we compute the entropies of the left and right splits and calculate the information gain.\n6. Finally we choose the threshold that yields the highest gain (using the smallest threshold in case of ties) and round the result.\n7. If no split yields a positive gain or if all feature values are identical then we return (None, 0.0).\n\nThis solution adheres to the specification in the task."}

The degree matrix D is computed as the row sum of W, and the Laplacian L = D - W.\n3. We use np.linalg.eigh to get the eigenvalues and eigenvectors and select the first k eigenvectors (columns) corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues. These eigenvectors form the low-dimensional representation E.\n4. For clustering, we run a manual implementation of k-means on the rows of E. We use the first k rows of E as the initial centroids to ensure deterministic behavior. Euclidean distances (squared for efficiency) are used to assign points to centroids. Centroids are re-computed and if a cluster becomes empty, its centroid is reinitialized with a random point from E.\n5. Finally, the function returns the list of cluster labels.\n\nThis solution meets the requirements and uses only NumPy for numerical computations."}

The function first sets max_freq to fs/2 (Nyquist) if not given.\n2. It defines helper functions to convert between Hz and Mel.\n3. It computes n_filters+2 mel points between the mel values corresponding to min_freq and max_freq. These are then mapped back to Hertz to serve as the triangle corner frequencies.\n4. The FFT bin centre frequencies are generated and for each filter (i.e. each triangle), the rising and falling slopes are computed. The weight is taken as the non\u2013negative minimum of both slopes.\n5. If the normalize flag is true, each filter is scaled by 2/(f_right - f_left).\n6. The resulting NumPy matrix is rounded to four decimal places and converted into a standard Python nested list.\n\nThis implementation meets the specification described in the task."}

We initialize sample weights equally.\n2. For each boosting round, we try every feature, every candidate threshold (using the unique feature values), and both polarities. We compute the weighted error for that stump and select the one with minimum error.\n3. We compute the vote weight (alpha) as 0.5 * ln((1-\u03b5)/\u03b5), and update the weights by multiplying by exp(-alpha * y * prediction). A normalization step ensures the weights sum to one.\n4. When predicting new samples, we sum the \u03b1-weighted predictions of each stump and assign the label according to the sign (with sign defined such that non-negative sums map to +1).\n\nThis solution uses only math and numpy and returns the predictions as a list of integers (either \u20131 or 1)."}
{"task_id": 329, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "We can solve the problem by using NumPy to generate the frequency bins. Notice that if positive_only is True, we need only the non-negative frequencies (k = 0 to \u230aN/2\u230b). Otherwise, we want all N bins arranged as NumPy\u2019s fftfreq does.

We first check if N or fs is non-positive. If so, we return an empty list.\n2. For positive_only=True, we generate an array from 0 up to \u230aN/2\u230b multiplied by (fs/N) as the bin centre frequencies.\n3. For positive_only=False, we use np.fft.fftfreq(N, d=1/fs) to get the full list of bins arranged as required.\n4.

The function first calculates the effective kernel size using the dilation factor. (Recall that if dilation==0 then effective kernel size is the same as the original kernel.)\n\n2. It then processes the padding specification. For pad='same' the total padding along each spatial dimension equals the effective kernel size minus 1. For other pad types (int, 2\u2010tuple, or 4\u2010tuple) the code computes the per\u2010side pads.\n\n3. The code pads the input images accordingly using np.pad.\n\n4. It computes the output spatial dimensions using the padded dimensions and effective kernel size.\n\n5. The im2col step is implemented by looping over each height and width index in the kernel.\n   For each (i, j) position, the corresponding patch is extracted from the padded input (taking strides and dilation into account). All patches are concatenated along the channel axis.\n\n6. The patches are reshaped to a 2-D matrix and then multiplied (via GEMM using the @ operator) by the appropriately reshaped kernel weights.\n\n7. Finally, the result is reshaped to (n_ex, out_rows, out_cols, out_ch) and returned as a (deep) Python list.\n\nThis solution meets the requirements using only NumPy."}

We start by defining a TreeNode class that represents a leaf (holding a prediction) or a split node (with a feature index, threshold and left/right children).\n2. In build_tree(), we iterate over each feature and try candidate thresholds computed as midpoints between adjacent unique sorted values. The candidate split that minimizes the weighted mean squared error is chosen if it yields an improvement over the current node's mse.\n3. In the boosting loop, the residuals (y_train \u2013 current training prediction) are computed and a regression tree is fit to these residuals. The tree\u2019s predictions are scaled with the learning_rate and added to the current predictions.\n4. Finally, predictions for X_test are computed in a similar way \u2013 starting from the initial prediction and adding contributions from each tree.\n5. All predictions are rounded to four decimal places and returned as a standard Python list.\n\nThis solution meets the task\u2019s requirements while using only NumPy for numerical operations."}

The code begins by counting individual items. Each itemset is saved as a frozenset.\n2. The candidate generation function, generate_candidates, takes two frequent itemsets of size k\u20131 if they share the same prefix (the first k\u20132 sorted items) then it joins them. It then prunes any candidate whose (k\u20131)-subsets are not all frequent.\n3.

If the number of neighbors is below min_samples then the point is marked as noise (-1).  \n6. If there are enough neighbors, a new cluster is started. The cluster is then expanded using a seeds list which is appended with the neighbors of each core point found.  \n7. Noise points that are later reachable from a core point are reassigned to the cluster.  \n8. The new core points\u2019 neighbors are continuously added to the seeds list until no new point qualifies.  \n9. Cluster ids start at 0 and are increased sequentially in the order they are discovered.\n\nThis implementation fully satisfies the constraints and does not rely on external ML libraries."}

The predict_value function traverses the tree:\n   - If the current node is a leaf, it returns its stored value.\n   - Otherwise, the test value is compared with the threshold to determine which child node to traverse.\n\n3.

In the beginning we do one pass through the transactions to count each item\u2019s global frequency. Items that do not meet the minimum support are dropped.\n\n2. For each transaction we then filter to only frequent items and order them by descending frequency (using a tie\u2010breaker on the item\u2019s natural order).\n\n3. The FP\u2010tree is built by \u201cinserting\u201d each sorted transaction. When inserting, if a prefix already exists then the counts are updated; also, each node is linked in a header table that lets one traverse all nodes with the same item.\n\n4. The mine_tree function then recursively builds conditional pattern bases for each item in the header table (processing items in increasing support order), builds a conditional FP\u2010tree from that base and then mines that tree. If the conditional tree is a single branch then all combinations along the branch are immediately enumerated.\n\n5. Finally, all frequent itemsets (with items sorted lexicographically inside the tuple) are collected in a set, converted to a list and sorted first by length then lexicographically.\n\nThis solution meets the task requirements."}

The function sets np.random.seed(42) so that all randomness is reproducible.\n2. Each isolation tree is built by randomly picking a subset of the data (if sample_size is larger than the number of points, the full data is used) and recursively splitting until the height limit (\u2308log\u2082(sample_size)\u2309) is reached or the node contains one or no observation.\n3. At every split a random feature and a random threshold (from [min, max] of that feature in the current node) are chosen. If a split would produce an empty branch the recursion stops.\n4. The path length for an observation is computed recursively through the tree and, when a leaf is reached, corrected with c(n) (which approximates the expected path length in a binary search tree).\n5. The anomaly score is computed as s(x)=2^{-(average_path_length/\u03c6)}.\n6. Finally, the top epsilon fraction of all observations (by score) are returned, with indices sorted in ascending order.\n\nThis implementation meets the specification described."}

The distance matrix is computed in one vectorized step using broadcasting, where each (i, j) entry is the Euclidean distance between data points i and j.\n2. For each sample i, after sorting the distances, the first neighbour is always the sample itself (with distance 0), so the k nearest neighbours are taken as the next k indices.\n3. Each reachability distance is the maximum of the k-distance of the neighbour q and the actual distance between p and q.\n4. The Local Reachability Density (LRD) for a sample is defined as k divided by the total reachability distances from that sample to its k neighbours.\n5. Finally, the LOF for each sample is computed as the average LRD of the sample's neighbours divided by its own LRD.\n6. All LOF scores are rounded to four decimals and any sample with LOF score strictly larger than epsilon is considered an outlier.\n\nYou can test or adjust this implementation according to your requirements."}
