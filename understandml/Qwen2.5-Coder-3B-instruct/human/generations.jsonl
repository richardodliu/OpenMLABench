The first row represents converting an empty string to the current prefix of `target`, which requires `j` insertions. Similarly, the first column represents converting the current prefix of `source` to an empty string, which requires `i` deletions.\n  \n- **Filling the Table**: For each pair of characters from `source` and `target`, we calculate the cost based on whether they match or not. We then update the DP table by considering the minimum cost among insertion, deletion, substitution, and transposition.\n\n- **Transposition**: The transposition operation involves checking if the characters at positions `i-2` and `j-2` in `source` and `target` are the same. If so, it counts as a single operation instead of two separate deletions and insertions.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the OSA distance using dynamic programming, with a time complexity of \\(O(m \\times n)\\)."}

{"task_id": 74, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the `create_row_hv` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Iterate over each feature in the input `row`.\n2. For each feature, retrieve the corresponding value from the `row`.\n3. Use the `random_seeds` dictionary to get the seed for the current feature.\n4. Generate a hypervector for the feature value using the seed.\n5. Combine all feature hypervectors into a single composite hypervector.\n6. Return the composite hypervector as a list.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef create_row_hv(row, dim, random_seeds):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the hypervectors for each feature\n    hv_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each feature in the row\n    for feature, value in row.items():\n        # Retrieve the seed for the current feature\n        seed = random_seeds.get(feature)\n        \n        # If a seed is available, generate a hypervector for the value\n        if seed is not None:\n            # Generate a random vector of length 'dim' using the seed\n            hv = np.random.RandomState(seed).normal(size=dim)\n            \n            # Append the generated hypervector to the list\n            hv_list.append(hv)\n    \n    # Combine all feature hypervectors into a single composite hypervector\n    composite_hv = np.concatenate(hv_list)\n    \n    # Convert the composite hypervector to a list and return it\n    return composite_hv.tolist()\n\n# Example usage:\nrow = {\n    \"feature1\": 0.5,\n    \"feature2\": 1.2,\n    \"feature3\": -0.8\n}\ndim = 10\nrandom_seeds = {\n    \"feature1\": 42,\n    \"feature2\": 77,\n    \"feature3\": 123\n}\n\ncomposite_hv = create_row_hv(row, dim, random_seeds)\nprint(composite_hv)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Random State Initialization**: We use `np.random.RandomState(seed)` to initialize a random number generator with a specific seed. This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is produced for the same seed, making the results reproducible.\n  \n- **Feature Value Handling**: For each feature, we check if a seed exists in the `random_seeds` dictionary. If it does, we generate a normal distribution of random numbers of length `dim` using this seed.\n\n- **Combining Hypervectors**: We concatenate all the individual hypervectors into a single composite hypervector using `np.concatenate`.\n\n- **Return as List**: Finally, we convert the composite hypervector to a list and return it.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the values associated with each feature are numeric and can be used to generate a hypervector.

Convert the Chi-square statistic to the Phi coefficient.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef phi_corr(x: list[int], y: list[int]) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Phi coefficient between two binary variables.\n\n    Args:\n    x (list[int]): A list of binary values (0 or 1).\n    y (list[int]): A list of binary values (0 or 1).\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The Phi coefficient rounded to 4 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a contingency table\n    contingency_table = np.array([\n        [np.sum((x == 0) & (y == 0)), np.sum((x == 0) & (y == 1))],\n        [np.sum((x == 1) & (y == 0)), np.sum((x == 1) & (y == 1))]\n    ])\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of observations\n    n = contingency_table.sum()\n    \n    # Calculate the expected frequencies\n    exp_freq = (\n        contingency_table.sum(axis=0).sum() * contingency_table.sum(axis=1).sum() / n\n    )\n    \n    # Calculate the Chi-square statistic\n    chi_square_stat = ((contingency_table - exp_freq) ** 2 / exp_freq).sum()\n    \n    # Calculate the degrees of freedom\n    df = (len(x) - 1) * (len(y) - 1)\n    \n    # Calculate the Phi coefficient\n    phi_coefficient = np.sqrt(chi_square_stat / df)\n    \n    # Return the Phi coefficient rounded to 4 decimal places\n    return round(phi_coefficient, 4)\n\n# Example usage:\nx = [0, 1, 1, 0]\ny = [0, 0, 1, 1]\nprint(phi_corr(x, y))  # Output: 0.5774\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Contingency Table**: We create a 2x2 contingency table that shows the counts of each combination of binary values from `x` and `y`.\n  \n- **Expected Frequencies**: The expected frequency for each cell is calculated as the product of the row totals and column totals divided by the total number of observations.\n\n- **Chi-Square Statistic**: This is calculated as the sum of squared differences between observed and expected frequencies, divided by the expected frequencies.\n\n- **Degrees of Freedom**: For a 2x2 contingency table, the degrees of freedom are `(n-1)*(m-1)` where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the table.\n\n- **Phi Coefficient**: The Phi coefficient is the square root of the Chi-square statistic divided by the degrees of freedom.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the Phi coefficient is correctly calculated and returned rounded to four decimal places."}

If so, we apply the linear transformation \\(0.2x + 0.5\\) to scale and shift the values to fit within the range [0, 1].\n- Finally, if `x` is greater than or equal to `2.5`, we return `1`.\n\nThis function efficiently approximates the behavior of the standard sigmoid function while being faster due to its linear nature."}

{"task_id": 128, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "Here's a Python implementation of the Dynamic Tanh (DyT) function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef dynamic_tanh(x: np.ndarray, alpha: float, gamma: float, beta: float) -> list[float]:\n    # Apply the DyT transformation\n    y = alpha * np.tanh(gamma * x + beta)\n    \n    # Round the results to the nearest 4th decimal\n    rounded_y = np.round(y, decimals=4)\n    \n    # Convert the result to a list\n    return rounded_y.tolist()\n\n# Example usage:\nx = np.array([1.0, -2.5, 3.7])\nalpha = 0.5\ngamma = 2.0\nbeta = -1.0\n\nresult = dynamic_tanh(x, alpha, gamma, beta)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `x`: The input array for which you want to compute the DyT transformation.\n  - `alpha`, `gamma`, `beta`: Parameters that control the shape of the DyT activation function.\n\n- **Transformation**:\n  - The DyT function applies the formula \\( y = \\alpha \\cdot \\tanh(\\gamma \\cdot x + \\beta) \\), where \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\gamma\\), and \\(\\beta\\) are hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize performance.\n\n- **Rounding**:\n  - The results are rounded to the nearest 4th decimal using `np.round()`.\n\n- **Output**:\n  - The transformed values are returned as a list using `tolist()`.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input `x` is a NumPy array. Adjust the parameters `alpha`, `gamma`, and `beta` based on your specific use case to achieve desired behavior."}
