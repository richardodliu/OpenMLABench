The link and inverse link functions are both the identity function, and the derivative is always 1.\n- **Log Link**: The link function is the natural logarithm, which transforms \u03bc into log(\u03bc). The inverse link is the exponential function, converting \u03b7 back to \u03bc. The derivative is the reciprocal of \u03bc, which is the derivative of the log function.\n- **Logit Link**: The logit function is used for binary data and involves the logarithm of the odds ratio. The inverse is the sigmoid function, which maps any real number \u03b7 to a probability between 0 and 1. The derivative of the logit function is \\( 1/(\\mu(1-\\mu)) \\), which is derived from the derivative of the logarithm of the odds ratio.\n\nEach of these functions is implemented using lambda functions that handle numpy arrays and scalars element-wise, ensuring compatibility with various input shapes.

For each node, if it contains fewer than three samples, it becomes a leaf node. Otherwise, a random feature and split value are chosen to partition the samples into left and right children.\n3. **Depth Tracking**: After constructing the tree, a stack-based traversal (DFS) is used to visit each node. For leaf nodes, the depth of each sample in the node is recorded in the `depths` list.\n4. **Random Seed**: The random seed is set to 0 at the beginning of the function to ensure reproducible results, as required.\n\nThis approach efficiently builds the isolation tree and accurately records the depth of each sample, adhering to the specified rules and constraints."}

This matrix will hold the accumulated scores for each sample and class.\n2. **Accumulating Scores**: For each tree's prediction, the prediction is scaled by the negative learning rate (equivalent to subtracting the product of learning rate and prediction from the score) and added to the score matrix. This step aggregates the contributions of all trees.\n3. **Softmax Application**: To convert the accumulated scores into probabilities, the softmax function is applied. For numerical stability, each row of the score matrix is adjusted by subtracting its maximum value before exponentiation. The softmax probabilities are then computed by taking the exponentiated values and normalizing them by the sum of exponentiated values for each row.\n4. **Class Prediction**: The class with the highest probability for each sample is determined using `numpy.argmax`, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value in case of ties. The resulting array of class indices is converted to a Python list and returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently replicates the XGBoost inference process, handling the aggregation and transformation steps as specified."}

For each level, generate candidates, count their support, and retain only those that meet the minimum support threshold.\n3. **Count Support for Itemsets**: For each candidate itemset, count how many transactions contain all items in the itemset. This involves checking each transaction to see if it includes every item in the candidate itemset.\n4. **Prune Infrequent Itemsets**: After counting the support for each candidate itemset, retain only those itemsets whose support meets or exceeds the minimum support count.\n5. **Return Results**: Collect all frequent itemsets along with their support counts into a dictionary, where each itemset is represented as a sorted tuple to ensure consistency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Tuple, Hashable\n\ndef find_frequent_itemsets(transactions: List[List[Hashable]], minsup: float) -> Dict[Tuple[Hashable, ...], int]:\n    \"\"\"Return all frequent itemsets in **transactions**.\"\"\"\n    if not transactions or minsup <= 0:\n        return {}\n    \n    N = len(transactions)\n    min_support_count = math.ceil(minsup * N)\n    if min_support_count < 1:\n        min_support_count = 1\n    \n    # Preprocess transactions to remove duplicates and convert to sets for faster checking\n    transaction_sets = [set(t) for t in transactions]\n    \n    # First pass: find frequent single items\n    item_counter = defaultdict(int)\n    for t in transaction_sets:\n        for item in t:\n            item_counter[item] += 1\n    \n    frequent_items = {item for item, count in item_counter.items() if count >= min_support_count}\n    frequent_itemsets = {}\n    previous_level = [frozenset([item]) for item in sorted(frequent_items)]\n    \n    # Add frequent single items to the result\n    for itemset in previous_level:\n        itemset_tuple = tuple(sorted(itemset))\n        frequent_itemsets[itemset_tuple] = item_counter[next(iter(itemset))]\n    \n    k = 2\n    while previous_level:\n        current_level = []\n        # Generate candidate itemsets of size k\n        candidates = set()\n        # Join step: generate candidates by joining previous_level itemsets\n        for i in range(len(previous_level)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(previous_level)):\n                itemset1 = previous_level[i]\n                itemset2 = previous_level[j]\n                new_candidate = itemset1.union(itemset2)\n                if len(new_candidate) == k:\n                    candidates.add(new_candidate)\n        candidates = list(candidates)\n        \n        # Count support for each candidate\n        candidate_support = defaultdict(int)\n        for candidate in candidates:\n            candidate_tuple = tuple(sorted(candidate))\n            for t in transaction_sets:\n                if candidate.issubset(t):\n                    candidate_support[candidate_tuple] += 1\n        \n        # Prune candidates that do not meet the min support\n        new_frequent_itemsets = {}\n        for itemset_tuple, count in candidate_support.items():\n            if count >= min_support_count:\n                new_frequent_itemsets[itemset_tuple] = count\n        \n        if not new_frequent_itemsets:\n            break\n        \n        frequent_itemsets.update(new_frequent_itemsets)\n        previous_level = [frozenset(itemset) for itemset in new_frequent_itemsets.keys()]\n        k += 1\n    \n    return frequent_itemsets\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Setup**: The function starts by checking if the transactions list is empty or if the minimum support is non-positive, returning an empty dictionary in such cases.\n2. **Minimum Support Calculation**: The minimum support count is calculated by multiplying the total number of transactions by the given threshold and rounding up to the nearest integer.\n3. **First Pass for Single Items**: The algorithm counts the occurrences of each individual item across all transactions. Items that meet or exceed the minimum support count are retained as frequent single items.\n4. **Generating Larger Itemsets**: Using the Apriori approach, the algorithm generates candidate itemsets of increasing size (k) by joining frequent itemsets from the previous level (k-1). For each candidate, it checks how many transactions contain all items in the candidate.\n5. **Pruning Candidates**: Candidates that do not meet the minimum support count are discarded. The remaining candidates are added to the result dictionary.\n6. **Termination**: The loop terminates when no new frequent itemsets are found for a given size k. The result dictionary, containing all frequent itemsets and their support counts, is returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space by leveraging the Apriori principle, which states that any subset of a frequent itemset must also be frequent, thus reducing the number of candidates that need to be checked."}

If scores are equal, the item with the smaller index comes first.\n   - Return the top-k items or fewer if there are not enough unrated items.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef knn_recommend(data: np.ndarray,\n                  user_ind: int,\n                  k: int,\n                  criterion: str = 'cosine') -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Item-based k-NN collaborative filtering recommender.\"\"\"\n    n_users, n_items = data.shape\n    S = np.zeros((n_items, n_items))\n    \n    # Step 1: Build the item-item similarity matrix S\n    for i in range(n_items):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n_items):\n            # Find users who rated both items i and j\n            rated_both = (data[:, i] > 0) & (data[:, j] > 0)\n            v1 = data[rated_both, i]\n            v2 = data[rated_both, j]\n            \n            if len(v1) == 0:\n                S[i, j] = 0\n                S[j, i] = 0\n                continue\n            \n            if criterion == 'cosine':\n                # Mean center each vector if std > 1e-3\n                if np.std(v1) > 1e-3:\n                    v1 = v1 - np.mean(v1)\n                if np.std(v2) > 1e-3:\n                    v2 = v2 - np.mean(v2)\n                # Compute cosine similarity\n                dot_product = np.dot(v1, v2)\n                norm_v1 = np.linalg.norm(v1)\n                norm_v2 = np.linalg.norm(v2)\n                if norm_v1 > 0 and norm_v2 > 0:\n                    similarity = dot_product / (norm_v1 * norm_v2)\n                else:\n                    similarity = 0\n            elif criterion == 'pearson':\n                # Compute Pearson correlation\n                if len(v1) < 2:\n                    similarity = 0\n                else:\n                    corr_matrix = np.corrcoef(v1, v2)\n                    similarity = corr_matrix[0, 1] if not np.isnan(corr_matrix[0, 1]) else 0\n            else:\n                raise ValueError(\"Invalid criterion.

For each pair, it computes either cosine similarity (with mean-centering if the standard deviation is significant) or Pearson correlation, storing these values in the matrix S.\n\n2. **Identifying Rated and Unrated Items**:\n   - The active user's ratings are checked to find which items they have and haven't rated. If all items are rated or none are, an empty list is returned.\n\n3. **Score Prediction**:\n   - For each unrated item, the score is computed by taking a weighted average of the user's ratings for other items, weighted by the similarity between the unrated item and each rated item. The denominator normalizes this by the sum of absolute similarities to avoid bias.\n\n4. **Sorting and Selecting Top-k**:\n   - Unrated items are sorted by their predicted scores in descending order. Items with the same score are sorted by their index in ascending order. The top-k items are then returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages item similarities and user ratings to generate personalized recommendations, adhering closely to the specified algorithm."}

The sigmoid function is defined as \\( \\sigma(\\hat{y}) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\hat{y}}} \\).\n2. **Loss Calculation**: For each sample, compute the binary cross-entropy loss using the formula \\( \\text{loss}_i = -[y_i \\log(p_i) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - p_i)] \\). To avoid numerical instability (like log(0)), we clip the probabilities to be within a small epsilon (\u03b5) away from 0 and 1.\n3. **Gradient Calculation**: The gradient for each sample is \\( \\nabla_i = p_i - y_i \\).\n4. **Hessian Calculation**: The Hessian diagonal element for each sample is \\( H_i = p_i (1 - p_i) \\).\n5. **Mean Loss**: Compute the mean of all individual losses.\n6. **Rounding**: Round all computed values (mean loss, gradient elements, Hessian elements) to four decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef logistic_loss_metrics(y: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray) -> tuple[float, list[float], list[float]]:\n    \"\"\"Compute binary logistic loss together with its gradient and Hessian.\n\n    Args:\n        y (np.ndarray): Binary ground-truth labels (0 or 1) of shape (n,).\n        y_pred (np.ndarray): Predicted logits of shape (n,).\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (mean_loss, gradient, hessian) where\n            mean_loss (float): Mean cross-entropy loss across all samples\n                               rounded to 4 decimal places.\n            gradient (list[float]): First derivative for every sample,\n                                    each value rounded to 4 decimals.\n            hessian (list[float]): Second derivative (diagonal of the\n                                   Hessian) for every sample, rounded to\n                                   4 decimals.\n    \"\"\"\n    epsilon = 1e-15\n    # Compute sigmoid probabilities\n    p = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-y_pred))\n    # Clip probabilities to avoid log(0)\n    p_clipped = np.clip(p, epsilon, 1 - epsilon)\n    \n    # Compute individual losses\n    losses = - (y * np.log(p_clipped) + (1 - y) * np.log(1 - p_clipped))\n    mean_loss = np.mean(losses)\n    \n    # Compute gradient and Hessian\n    gradient = p - y\n    hessian = p * (1 - p)\n    \n    # Round all values to 4 decimal places\n    mean_loss_rounded = round(float(mean_loss), 4)\n    gradient_rounded = [round(float(g), 4) for g in gradient]\n    hessian_rounded = [round(float(h), 4) for h in hessian]\n    \n    return (mean_loss_rounded, gradient_rounded, hessian_rounded)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sigmoid Calculation**: The sigmoid function converts logits into probabilities, which are clipped to avoid numerical instability during log calculations.\n2. **Loss Calculation**: The binary cross-entropy loss is computed for each sample by taking the negative log of the predicted probabilities for the actual class. The mean of these losses is then calculated.\n3. **Gradient and Hessian**: The gradient is the difference between the predicted probability and the actual label. The Hessian diagonal elements are the product of the probability and its complement (p*(1-p)), representing the second derivative of the loss with respect to the logits.\n4. **Rounding**: All results are rounded to four decimal places to meet the output constraints. The mean loss is returned as a float, while the gradient and Hessian elements are returned as lists of rounded floats.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required metrics while ensuring numerical stability and adherence to precision requirements."}
{"task_id": 16, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to generate all contiguous N-grams from a given sequence. An N-gram is a sliding window of length N taken from consecutive elements of the sequence. The solution involves iterating through the sequence and extracting each possible window of size N.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Edge Cases**: If the sequence length is less than N, return an empty list since no N-grams can be formed.\n2. **Generate N-grams**: For a sequence of length L, there will be L - N + 1 N-grams. For each starting index from 0 to L - N, extract a slice of the sequence from the starting index to starting index + N.\n3. **Convert Slices to Tuples**: Each slice should be converted into a tuple to ensure immutability and consistency in the output format.\n4. **Return the Result**: Collect all these tuples into a list and return it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, Iterable, List, Tuple\n\ndef ngrams(sequence: Iterable[Any], N: int) -> List[Tuple[Any, ...]]:\n    \"\"\"Return all contiguous N-grams of *sequence*.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence: An ordered, sliceable container (e.g., list, tuple, string).\n        N: Length of each n-gram (must be an integer \u2265 1).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of tuples, each containing exactly *N* consecutive elements\n        from *sequence*.  If *N* is larger than *len(sequence)* the function\n        returns an empty list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if N <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"N must be \u2265 1\")\n    sequence_list = list(sequence) if not isinstance(sequence, (str, tuple, list)) else sequence\n    if len(sequence_list) < N:\n        return []\n    return [tuple(sequence_list[i:i+N]) for i in range(len(sequence_list) - N + 1)]\n```\n\nWait, but the original sequence might be a string, list, or tuple. For strings, each character is treated as an atomic token. The code should handle all these cases without converting the sequence into a list unless necessary. However, in Python, strings, lists, and tuples all support slicing, so we can directly slice them.\n\nBut the problem states that the sequence is any ordered sequence that supports slicing. So the solution can directly use slicing on the original sequence without converting it to a list. For example, for a string \"hello\", slicing \"hello\"[0:2] gives \"he\", which when converted to a tuple becomes ('h', 'e').\n\nSo the correct approach is to iterate from 0 to len(sequence) - N, and for each i, take sequence[i:i+N] and convert it to a tuple.\n\nThus, the solution can be simplified to:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, Iterable, List, Tuple\n\ndef ngrams(sequence: Iterable[Any], N: int) -> List[Tuple[Any, ...]]:\n    \"\"\"Return all contiguous N-grams of *sequence*.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence: An ordered, sliceable container (e.g., list, tuple, string).\n        N: Length of each n-gram (must be an integer \u2265 1).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of tuples, each containing exactly *N* consecutive elements\n        from *sequence*.  If *N* is larger than *len(sequence)* the function\n        returns an empty list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if N < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"N must be \u2265 1\")\n    if len(sequence) < N:\n        return []\n    return [tuple(sequence[i:i+N]) for i in range(len(sequence) - N + 1)]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Edge Handling**: The function first checks if N is less than 1 and raises a ValueError if so. This ensures N is a positive integer.\n2. **Early Return for Large N**: If the length of the sequence is less than N, the function returns an empty list immediately since no N-grams can be formed.\n3. **List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension to generate each N-gram. For each index `i` from 0 to `len(sequence) - N`, it slices the sequence from `i` to `i+N` and converts the slice into a tuple. This ensures each N-gram is a tuple of N consecutive elements.\n4. **Return Result**: The list of tuples is returned, each representing an N-gram in the order they appear in the original sequence.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all types of sequences that support slicing (strings, lists, tuples) and meets all the specified requirements."}

Then, for each node, if it is not the root, add its dictionary to the children list of its parent node.

These dictionaries are stored in a list called `nodes`.\n3. **Root Identification**: The root node is identified by finding the index where the parent value is -1 in the parents list.\n4. **Tree Construction**: The function then iterates through each node again.

The thresholds are set to midpoints between consecutive unique values to ensure splits are between actual data points.\n4. **Split Validation**: For each threshold, the samples are split into left and right nodes. The split is valid only if both nodes contain at least two samples.\n5. **Gain Calculation**: For valid splits, the loss for each child node is computed. The gain is the difference between the parent node's loss and the sum of the child nodes' losses.\n6. **Best Split Tracking**: The split with the highest positive gain is tracked. If no such split exists, the function returns None; otherwise, it returns the best feature and threshold.\n\nThis approach efficiently evaluates all possible splits while adhering to the constraints, ensuring optimal performance for gradient-boosting trees."}

For each value, it checks if the value is already numeric (int or float) and leaves it unchanged. If the value is a string, it attempts to convert it to a float. If the conversion fails, Python's `float()` function raises a `ValueError`, which propagates up as required. The converted values are returned as a tuple.\n2. **validate_input Decorator**: The decorator uses `check_data` to sanitize the inputs before they are passed to the decorated function. The wrapper function inside the decorator calls `check_data(a, b)` to get sanitized values, then invokes the original function with these values.\n3. **sum_numbers Function**: This function, decorated with `validate_input`, receives sanitized numeric inputs. It computes their sum and returns the result as an integer if the sum is a whole number (e.g., 4.0 becomes 4), otherwise as a float. This ensures the output meets the specified constraints.\n\nBy following this approach, the solution ensures that inputs are properly sanitized before any operations are performed, leveraging Python's built-in type checking and conversion mechanisms for robustness and simplicity."}

If `res` is None, it returns -1 as a fallback, though typically, leaf nodes should have a valid `res` value.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the traversal of the decision tree, ensuring that all edge cases (missing features or values) are properly managed by returning -1 when the path cannot be completed."}

The stride in the second dimension (frame elements) will be the same as the original array's stride.\n4. **Create View**: Use `as_strided` to create the view with the calculated shape and strides.\n5. **Set Writable Flag**: Adjust the writability of the returned array based on the `writeable` parameter.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.lib.stride_tricks import as_strided\n\ndef to_frames(x: np.ndarray, frame_width: int, stride: int, writeable: bool = False) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Convert a 1-D signal into overlapping frames.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : np.ndarray\n        One-dimensional input signal of length *N*.\n    frame_width : int\n        The length (*in samples*) of each output frame.\n    stride : int\n        Hop length \u2013 number of samples between the starts of successive frames.\n    writeable : bool, default=False\n        If *False* the returned view is read-only; if *True* it is writeable\n        whenever the source array was writeable.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    np.ndarray\n        A view on *x* with shape ``(n_frames, frame_width)`` where\n        ``n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1``.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Input validation\n    assert x.ndim == 1, \"x must be one-dimensional\"\n    assert stride >= 1, \"stride must be a positive integer\"\n    assert len(x) >= frame_width, \"len(x) must be at least frame_width\"\n    \n    n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1\n    if n_frames < 1:\n        return np.empty((0, frame_width), dtype=x.dtype)\n    \n    # Calculate the new shape and strides\n    new_shape = (n_frames, frame_width)\n    original_stride = x.strides[0]\n    new_strides = (stride * original_stride, original_stride)\n    \n    # Create the view\n    framed = as_strided(x, shape=new_shape, strides=new_strides)\n    \n    # Handle writeable flag\n    if not writeable:\n        framed.flags.writeable = False\n    \n    return framed\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input array `x` is one-dimensional, if the stride is at least 1, and if the length of `x` is sufficient to form at least one frame of width `frame_width`. If any of these conditions are not met, an `AssertionError` is raised.\n2. **Frame Calculation**: The number of frames is computed using the formula `(len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1`. This formula ensures that we only consider complete frames without any trailing samples that cannot form a full frame.\n3. **Stride Manipulation**: The `as_strided` function is used to create a view of the original array. The strides for the new array are calculated such that the first dimension (frames) steps by `stride` times the original stride (in bytes), and the second dimension (frame elements) steps by the original stride. This allows the view to represent overlapping frames efficiently without copying data.\n4. **Writability Control**: The `writeable` parameter determines whether the returned array can be modified. If `writeable` is `False`, the array's writable flag is set to `False` to prevent modifications.\n\nThis approach efficiently creates a view of the original array with overlapping frames, leveraging NumPy's stride manipulation for optimal performance."}

If not, it returns -1.\n2. **Heap Operations**: The helper functions `_move_up` and `_move_down` ensure the max-heap property is maintained after insertions and deletions. `_move_up` is used when adding a new element to the heap, moving it up if it is larger than its parent. `_move_down` is used when replacing the root, moving the new root down if it is smaller than its children.\n3. **Processing Elements**: For each element in the list, if the heap has space, the element is added and moved up to maintain the heap. If the heap is full, the element is compared with the root (the largest element in the heap). If it is smaller, the root is replaced, and the new root is moved down to restore the heap property.\n4. **Result Preparation**: After processing all elements, the heap contains the k smallest elements. These are then sorted in ascending order and returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently maintains the k smallest elements in O(n log k) time complexity, which is optimal for this problem, and avoids sorting the entire list.

{"task_id": 54, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a whitespace tokenizer that processes a text string according to several optional parameters: converting to lowercase, filtering stop-words, and stripping punctuation. The solution involves breaking down the input string into tokens based on whitespace, then applying each of the specified filters in sequence while preserving the original order of tokens.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Lowercase Conversion**: If the `lowercase` parameter is True, convert the entire input string to lowercase before any further processing.\n2. **Whitespace Tokenization**: Split the string into tokens using whitespace as the delimiter. This will handle any sequence of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) as a single delimiter.\n3. **Punctuation Stripping**: For each token, if the `filter_punctuation` parameter is True, remove any punctuation characters from the start and end of the token. Punctuation characters in the middle of the token are left intact.

This ensures uniformity in subsequent processing steps.\n2. **Whitespace Tokenization**: The string is split into tokens using the `split()` method, which handles any whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) as a delimiter.\n3. **Punctuation Stripping**: Each token is processed to remove any leading or trailing punctuation characters using the `strip()` method with `string.punctuation` (which contains all ASCII punctuation characters). If this results in an empty string, the token is skipped.\n4. **Stop-word Filtering**: Each processed token is checked against a predefined set of common English stop-words. If the token matches any stop-word and `filter_stopwords` is True, it is excluded from the result list.\n5. **Result Compilation**: The remaining tokens are collected in their original order, ensuring only valid, non-empty strings are included in the final output list.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input string according to the specified parameters, providing flexibility in tokenization while maintaining the original token order and ensuring only relevant tokens are included in the result."}

The final weights are rounded to four decimal places and returned as a list.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both full-batch and mini-batch processing, leveraging RMSprop's adaptive learning rate to converge quickly while avoiding the pitfalls of fixed learning rates."}
{"task_id": 56, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the SoftPlus activation function and its derivative in a numerically stable way. The SoftPlus function is defined as \\(\\log(1 + e^x)\\), and its derivative is the sigmoid function \\(\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\\). The challenge is to handle large values of \\(x\\) to avoid overflow or underflow, especially when \\(x\\) is very large or very negative.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Numerical Stability**: For large positive values of \\(x\\), \\(e^x\\) can overflow. To handle this, we can use the identity \\(\\log(1 + e^x) = x + \\log(1 + e^{-x})\\) when \\(x > 0\\). This avoids overflow because \\(e^{-x}\\) becomes very small for large \\(x\\). For negative \\(x\\), directly computing \\(\\log(1 + e^x)\\) is stable because \\(e^x\\) is small.\n2. **Derivative Handling**: The derivative of SoftPlus is the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function can be computed as \\(1 / (1 + e^{-x})\\), which is numerically stable for all \\(x\\) if implemented correctly. For large positive \\(x\\), the sigmoid approaches 1, and for large negative \\(x\\), it approaches 0.\n3. **Rounding**: The results should be rounded to the nearest 4th decimal place.

The sigmoid is computed in a numerically stable way by handling positive and negative values separately to avoid overflow. For positive values, it uses \\(1 / (1 + e^{-x})\\), and for negative values, it uses \\(e^x / (1 + e^x)\\).\n   \n2. **Handling SoftPlus**:\n   - For the SoftPlus case (`deriv=False`), the function uses the identity \\(\\log(1 + e^x) = x + \\log(1 + e^{-x})\\) for positive \\(x\\) to avoid overflow. For negative \\(x\\), it directly computes \\(\\log(1 + e^x)\\) which is stable. The `log1p` function is used for accurate computation of \\(\\log(1 + \\text{small value})\\).\n\n3. **Rounding and Return Types**:\n   - The results are rounded to four decimal places. If the input is a scalar, the function returns a float; if the input is a list or array, it returns a list of rounded values. The conversion between NumPy arrays and Python lists is handled using `tolist()` for array outputs.\n\nThis approach ensures numerical stability across all input ranges and adheres to the specified output constraints."}

For N=1, these are unigrams; for N>1, these are sequences of N words.\n3. **Build (N-1)-gram Counts (for N>1)**: For N>1, the probability of an N-gram is the count of the N-gram divided by the count of its prefix (the first N-1 words). Thus, we also need counts of (N-1)-grams.\n4. **Compute Sequence Log-Probability**: For each sliding window of length N in the sequence, compute the probability using the counts. If any N-gram or its prefix (for N>1) is not found in the corpus, return `-inf` immediately.

If the sequence length is less than N, it returns `-inf` because no N-grams can be formed.\n2. **Unigram Case (N=1)**: For unigrams, the probability of each word is its count in the corpus divided by the total corpus length. If any word in the sequence is not found in the corpus, the function returns `-inf`.\n3. **N-gram Case (N>1)**: For N-grams, the function counts all N-grams and their (N-1)-gram prefixes in the corpus. For each N-gram in the sequence, it checks if both the N-gram and its prefix exist in the corpus. If either is missing, it returns `-inf`. Otherwise, it computes the probability as the ratio of the N-gram count to the prefix count and accumulates the log of this probability.\n4. **Result Rounding**: The accumulated log-probability is rounded to 4 decimal places before returning.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for zero counts to handle unseen N-grams and ensures correctness by leveraging counts from the corpus for probability calculations."}

The residual calculation for updating the bias term (w0) should be `residual = y - (X_poly @ w - w[0])` because the current prediction is `X_poly @ w`, which includes w0 multiplied by 1's. So the residual for w0 should be `y - (X_poly @ w - w[0]) = y - (X_poly @ w) + w[0]`. So the code is correct in that part.\n\nBut another issue is that the regularization term in the objective function is \u03bb * sum |w_j| for j >=1. The coordinate descent update for w_j (j >=1) should involve \u03bb multiplied by m, because the objective function is (1/2m) * sum of squared errors + \u03bb * sum |w_j|. So the derivative of the regularization term with respect to w_j is \u03bb * sign(w_j), but the squared error term's derivative is (1/m) * X_j^T (y - Xw). So the condition for the soft threshold is whether |X_j^T (y - Xw + w_j X_j)| <= \u03bb * m. So the code's soft thresholding part is correct.\n\nBut wait, the original objective function is (1/(2m)) * sum (y_i - yhat_i)^2 + \u03bb sum |w_j|. The derivative of the first term with respect to w_j is (1/m) * X_j^T (y - Xw). So the condition for the soft threshold is whether X_j^T (y - Xw + w_j X_j) is within [-\u03bb m, \u03bb m]. So the code's soft thresholding is correct.\n\nSo the code should work as intended.\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Data Preparation**: The input features `X` and target values `y` are converted into NumPy arrays to facilitate numerical operations.\n2. **Design Matrix Construction**: The design matrix is constructed with columns representing `X` raised to powers from 0 (constant term) up to `degree`. This matrix is used for polynomial regression.\n3. **Weight Initialization**: The weight vector `w` is initialized to zeros, with length `degree + 1` (including the bias term).\n4. **Coordinate Descent**: The algorithm iteratively updates each weight:\n   - **Bias Term (w0)**: Updated as the mean of the residuals, which is derived from the current predictions excluding the bias term's contribution.\n   - **Other Weights (wj)**: Updated using the soft thresholding rule. For each weight, the algorithm checks if the correlation between the feature and the residual exceeds the regularization threshold. If it does, the weight is adjusted; otherwise, it is set to zero.\n5. **Convergence Check**: After each full pass over all weights, the maximum change in any weight is compared against the tolerance `tol`. If the change is below `tol`, the algorithm stops early.\n6. **Result Rounding**: The final weights are rounded to four decimal places and returned as a list.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the L1 regularization through coordinate descent, ensuring sparsity in the model weights while fitting polynomial features up to the specified degree."}

{"task_id": 68, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum update. The key steps involve computing the new velocity (momentum update) based on the previous velocity and the current gradient, then updating the parameters using this velocity. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Handle the Previous Update**: If `prev_update` is `None`, initialize it as a zero tensor with the same shape as the parameter tensor `w`.\n2. **Compute the New Velocity**: The new velocity is calculated as a weighted sum of the previous velocity and the current gradient. The formula for the new velocity is \\( u_t = \\text{momentum} \\times u_{t-1} + (1 - \\text{momentum}) \\times \\nabla_w \\).\n3. **Update the Parameters**: The parameters are updated by moving in the opposite direction of the new velocity scaled by the learning rate: \\( w_{t+1} = w_t - \\text{learning\\_rate} \\times u_t \\).\n4. **Round and Convert Results**: Both the updated parameters and the new velocity should be rounded to four decimal places and converted to Python lists before returning.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sgd_momentum_update(w: np.ndarray, grad: np.ndarray, learning_rate: float = 0.01, momentum: float = 0.0, prev_update: np.ndarray | None = None) -> tuple[list, list]:\n    \"\"\"Performs one SGD optimisation step with momentum.\n\n    Args:\n        w: Current parameters (NumPy array).\n        grad: Gradient of the loss with respect to *w*.\n        learning_rate: Learning rate controlling the update magnitude.\n        momentum: Momentum factor in the interval [0, 1].\n        prev_update: Previous momentum update / velocity.

This ensures that the first update starts with no prior velocity.\n2. **Computing New Velocity**: The new velocity is computed by taking a weighted average of the previous velocity and the current gradient. The weights are determined by the momentum factor. A higher momentum means the previous velocity has more influence, which helps in smoothing out the updates and accelerating convergence in the direction of persistent gradients.\n3. **Updating Parameters**: The parameters are updated by subtracting the product of the learning rate and the new velocity from the current parameters. This step moves the parameters in the direction that minimizes the loss function.\n4. **Rounding and Conversion**: The updated parameters and new velocity are rounded to four decimal places and converted to Python lists to meet the output constraints. This ensures the results are in the required format and precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently combines the benefits of momentum with SGD, providing smoother and potentially faster convergence compared to standard SGD."}

Items that do not meet the minimum support threshold are discarded.\n2. **Building the FP-Tree**: The FP-tree is constructed by processing each transaction. Items in each transaction are sorted by their frequency, and nodes are added to the tree accordingly. The tree structure allows efficient counting of item-sets.\n3. **Mining the FP-Tree**: The algorithm recursively processes each item in the header table, constructing conditional pattern bases and conditional FP-trees. This step ensures that all frequent item-sets are discovered by combining suffixes with frequent prefixes.\n4. **Sorting and Deduplication**: The resulting frequent item-sets are sorted lexicographically within each item-set and by length and lexicographical order for the outer list to meet the output constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently mines all frequent item-sets without generating candidates explicitly, leveraging the compact FP-tree structure for optimal performance."}

The last element of each sample is taken as the label.\n3. **Updating counts**: For each label encountered, the function checks if the label already exists in the dictionary. If it does, the count for that label is incremented by 1. If not, the label is added to the dictionary with an initial count of 1.\n4. **Edge Handling**: If the input data list is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns the initially empty dictionary.\n5. **Return Result**: After processing all samples, the dictionary containing label counts is returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts each label's occurrences in a single pass through the data, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of samples.

The VR is calculated by comparing the variance of the target values in the parent node with the weighted sum of the variances of the target values in the left and right child nodes. The solution involves calculating the population variance for each feature (column) of the target vectors, summing these variances, and then applying the given formula to determine the reduction in variance.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the total number of samples**: The parent node has `n` samples, the left child has `n_left` samples, and the right child has `n_right` samples.\n2. **Compute the population variance for each target vector**: For each of the parent, left, and right target vectors, compute the variance for each feature (column) and then sum these variances to get a single value. The population variance is calculated as the mean of the squared differences from the mean.\n3. **Apply the variance reduction formula**: The formula involves subtracting the weighted sum of the variances of the left and right child nodes from the variance of the parent node.

Each array can be multi-dimensional, where each column represents a different feature.\n2. **Sample Counts**: The number of samples in the parent node (`n`), left child (`n_left`), and right child (`n_right`) are determined from the first dimension of the respective arrays.\n3. **Variance Calculation**: The population variance (using `ddof=0`) for each feature in the parent and child nodes is computed.

The problem states that the function should return (AL, caches), but the task's expected return is just AL converted to a list. However, the function signature in the task returns a list[list[float]], which matches AL's converted list. So the caches are not part of the return value in the task's signature. \n\nBut the problem description says the function must return a tuple (AL, caches), but the provided function signature returns a list[list[float]]. This seems conflicting. \n\nWait, the task's signature is:\n\ndef L_model_forward(X: np.ndarray, parameters: dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> list[list[float]]:\n\nSo the function is supposed to return only the AL as a list.

The task's signature indicates that the function returns AL as a list, but the description says it should return (AL, caches). \n\nGiven that the grading only inspects AL, and the signature is as provided, the code should return AL as a list. The caches are not part of the return value in the signature. \n\nSo the code should compute the forward pass, store caches (even though they are not returned), and return AL as a list.\n\nThus, the solution is to proceed with the forward pass, but return only AL as a list.\n\nSo the code above is adjusted to not return the caches. \n\nBut the problem says: \"finally return a tuple (AL, caches) where AL is the activation produced by the last layer.\" But the function signature returns a list[list[float]]. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nGiven that the signature is provided by the task, and the note says that for grading only AL is inspected, the solution must adhere to the signature. \n\nSo the code should return AL as a list. \n\nThus, the caches are computed but not returned. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef L_model_forward(X: np.ndarray, parameters: dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> list[list[float]]:\n    caches = []\n    A = X\n    L = len(parameters) // 2  # number of layers\n    \n    for l in range(1, L):\n        W = parameters[f'W{l}']\n        b = parameters[f'b{l}']\n        Z = np.dot(W, A) + b\n        A = np.maximum(0, Z)  # ReLU\n        cache = (A, Z, W, b)  # or whatever structure is needed for backprop\n        caches.append(cache)\n    \n    # Output layer\n    WL = parameters[f'W{L}']\n    bL = parameters[f'b{L}']\n    ZL = np.dot(WL, A) + bL\n    AL = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-ZL))  # Sigmoid\n    cache = (A, ZL, WL, bL)\n    caches.append(cache)\n    \n    AL_rounded = np.round(AL, 4)\n    return AL_rounded.tolist()\n\nBut the problem says that the function must return a tuple (AL, caches). But the signature doesn't allow that. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nPerhaps the signature in the task is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return only AL as a list, and the caches are stored internally or the note about returning (AL, caches) is a mistake. \n\nGiven that the signature is provided and the note says grading only inspects AL, the solution must return AL as a list. \n\nSo the code above is correct. \n\nBut the problem description clearly states that the function must return (AL, caches). \n\nThis is a conflict. \n\nGiven that the signature is provided by the task, and the note says that grading only inspects AL, the solution must adhere to the signature. \n\nSo the code will return AL as a list. \n\nThus, the final code is:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef L_model_forward(X: np.ndarray, parameters: dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> list[list[float]]:\n    caches = []\n    A = X\n    L = len(parameters) // 2  # number of layers\n    \n    for l in range(1, L):\n        W = parameters[f'W{l}']\n        b = parameters[f'b{l}']\n        Z = np.dot(W, A) + b\n        A = np.maximum(0, Z)  # ReLU\n        cache = (A, Z, W, b)  # or other relevant values\n        caches.append(cache)\n    \n    # Output layer\n    WL = parameters[f'W{L}']\n    bL = parameters[f'b{L}']\n    ZL = np.dot(WL, A) + bL\n    AL = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-ZL))  # Sigmoid\n    cache = (A, ZL, WL, bL)\n    caches.append(cache)\n    \n    AL_rounded = np.round(AL, 4)\n    return AL_rounded.tolist()\n\nBut the caches are not returned. \n\nThe problem says the function must return (AL, caches), but the signature returns list[list[float]]. \n\nThis suggests that the signature in the task is incorrect. \n\nBut since the task's provided code starts with the given signature, and the note says grading only inspects AL, the solution must follow the signature. \n\nThus, the code returns AL as a list. \n\nThe caches are computed but not returned. \n\nThis is the only way to adhere to the signature. \n\nSo the code is correct as per the signature. \n\nThe problem description may have an error in the expected return type. \n\nThus, the solution is to proceed with the code that returns AL as a list. \n\nFinal answer:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef L_model_forward(X: np.ndarray, parameters: dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> list[list[float]]:\n    caches = []\n    A = X\n    L = len(parameters) // 2  # number of layers in the neural network\n    \n    for l in range(1, L):\n        W = parameters[f'W{l}']\n        b = parameters[f'b{l}']\n        Z = np.dot(W, A) + b\n        A = np.maximum(0, Z)  # ReLU activation\n        cache = (A, Z, W, b)\n        caches.append(cache)\n    \n    # Output layer\n    WL = parameters[f'W{L}']\n    bL = parameters[f'b{L}']\n    ZL = np.dot(WL, A) + bL\n    AL = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-ZL))  # Sigmoid activation\n    cache = (A, ZL, WL, bL)\n    caches.append(cache)\n    \n    AL_rounded = np.round(AL, 4)\n    return AL_rounded.tolist()\n```\n\nWait, but the cache structure may vary. The problem says \"you may store anything that is useful for a backward pass\". So the cache for each layer could be (A_prev, W, b, Z), or other variations. \n\nIn the code above, for each layer except the last, the cache is (A, Z, W, b). But A is the output of the activation (ReLU). For backpropagation, one would need the input to the linear step (A_prev), which is the previous layer's activation. \n\nSo the cache for each layer should include A_prev (the input to the linear step), W, b, and Z (the linear output before activation). \n\nSo for each layer l, during forward pass:\n\nA_prev is the activation from the previous layer (or X for the first layer).\n\nZ = W dot A_prev + b.\n\nA = g(Z), where g is ReLU for hidden layers or sigmoid for the output layer.\n\nFor backpropagation, the cache should include A_prev, W, b, and Z. \n\nSo the code should store these in the cache.\n\nThus, the code should be adjusted to store (A_prev, W, b, Z) in the cache for each layer.\n\nSo for each layer:\n\nA_prev is the activation from the previous layer.\n\nThen, compute Z and A.\n\nStore (A_prev, W, b, Z) in the cache.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nA = X\n\nfor l in range(1, L+1):\n\n    A_prev = A\n\n    W = parameters[f'W{l}']\n\n    b = parameters[f'b{l}']\n\n    Z = np.dot(W, A_prev) + b\n\n    if l != L:\n\n        A = np.maximum(0, Z)  # ReLU\n\n    else:\n\n        A = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-Z))  # Sigmoid\n\n    cache = (A_prev, W, b, Z)\n\n    caches.append(cache)\n\nBut the output is AL, which is A after the last layer.\n\nThen, the caches list has entries for each layer.\n\nBut the function returns only AL as a list.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef L_model_forward(X: np.ndarray, parameters: dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> list[list[float]]:\n\n    caches = []\n\n    A = X\n\n    L = len(parameters) // 2  # number of layers\n\n    for l in range(1, L + 1):\n\n        A_prev = A\n\n        W = parameters[f'W{l}']\n\n        b = parameters[f'b{l}']\n\n        Z = np.dot(W, A_prev) + b\n\n        if l != L:\n\n            A = np.maximum(0, Z)  # ReLU\n\n        else:\n\n            A = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-Z))  # Sigmoid\n\n        cache = (A_prev, W, b, Z)\n\n        caches.append(cache)\n\n    AL_rounded = np.round(A, 4)\n\n    return AL_rounded.tolist()\n\nThis way, the cache for each layer includes the necessary information for backpropagation.\n\nBut the function still returns only AL as a list, per the signature.\n\nThis should meet the requirements.\n\nSo the final code is:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef L_model_forward(X: np.ndarray, parameters: dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> list[list[float]]:\n    caches = []\n    A = X\n    L = len(parameters) // 2  # number of layers in the neural network\n    \n    for l in range(1, L + 1):\n        A_prev = A\n        W = parameters[f'W{l}']\n        b = parameters[f'b{l}']\n        Z = np.dot(W, A_prev) + b\n        if l != L:\n            A = np.maximum(0, Z)  # ReLU activation\n        else:\n            A = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-Z))  # Sigmoid activation\n        cache = (A_prev, W, b, Z)\n        caches.append(cache)\n    \n    AL_rounded = np.round(A, 4)\n    return AL_rounded.tolist()\n```\n\nNote that the caches are not returned, but the function returns AL as a list of lists, rounded to 4 decimal places. This matches the function signature and the note that grading only inspects AL. The caches are stored for potential use in backpropagation, even though they are not part of the return value. \n\nThis should be the correct solution."}

This ensures that we avoid taking the logarithm of 0 or 1, which would lead to numerical errors.\n2. **Reshape Arrays**: Ensure that both `A2` and `Y` are of the same shape. The input arrays might be of shape (1, m) or (m,), so we need to handle both cases by flattening them into 1-dimensional arrays.\n3. **Compute the Cost**: Use the formula for binary cross-entropy, which involves summing the element-wise products of the ground-truth labels and the logarithms of the predicted probabilities, plus the element-wise products of the complements of the labels and the logarithms of the complements of the probabilities.

This step ensures that we never take the logarithm of 0 or 1.\n2. **Flattening Arrays**: Both `A2` and `Y` are flattened into 1-dimensional arrays to handle cases where they might be provided as (1, m) or (m,) shaped arrays.

For all other actions, the probability is \\(\\epsilon / n\\).\n3. **Round Probabilities**: Each probability should be rounded to 4 decimal places.\n4. **Ensure Sum to 1**: The sum of all probabilities should be exactly 1, which is inherently satisfied by the \u03b5-soft policy definition but should be verified within a small numerical tolerance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef epsilon_soft(Q: list[float] | \"np.ndarray\", epsilon: float) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Return the \u03b5-soft probabilities for a set of Q-values.\n\n    Q is a sequence containing the Q-values for each possible action in a\n    single state.  epsilon (0 \u2264 \u03b5 \u2264 1) is the exploration parameter.\n\n    The returned list must contain the probability of selecting every action\n    under the \u03b5-soft policy, rounded to 4 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    Q_array = np.array(Q)\n    n = len(Q_array)\n    greedy_index = np.argmax(Q_array)  # returns the first occurrence in case of ties\n    probabilities = np.full(n, epsilon / n)\n    probabilities[greedy_index] = 1 - epsilon + (epsilon / n)\n    \n    # Round to 4 decimal places\n    rounded_probs = np.round(probabilities, 4)\n    \n    # Ensure the sum is 1 by adjusting the last element if necessary (though theoretically it should sum to 1)\n    # This step is precautionary, but the problem states the sum must be 1 within 1e-12 tolerance.\n    # Rounding might introduce tiny deviations, but the problem allows 1e-12 tolerance.\n    # So, the rounded values should sum to 1.0 when added.\n    # For example, 0.925 + 0.025 + 0.025 + 0.025 = 1.0, so no adjustment needed.\n    \n    return [float(prob) for prob in rounded_probs]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Identify Greedy Action**: The code converts the input Q-values into a NumPy array to leverage NumPy's `argmax` function, which efficiently finds the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value.\n2. **Calculate Probabilities**: The base probability for non-greedy actions is set to \\(\\epsilon / n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of actions. The greedy action's probability is adjusted to \\(1 - \\epsilon + (\\epsilon / n)\\).\n3. **Rounding**: The probabilities are rounded to four decimal places to meet the output constraints.\n4. **Return Probabilities**: The probabilities are converted from a NumPy array back to a list of floats for the final output. The sum of these probabilities will always be 1 (within a very small numerical tolerance) due to the way they are calculated, ensuring correctness.\n\nThis approach efficiently implements the \u03b5-soft policy by leveraging NumPy for array operations, ensuring clarity and correctness while adhering to the specified constraints."}

The input matrix `X` and output matrix `Y` are provided as NumPy arrays where each column represents an example. The task involves extracting the number of features from the input matrix and the number of output units from the output matrix, while the hidden layer size is fixed at 10.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Extract Input Features (n_x)**: The number of input features is determined by the number of rows in the input matrix `X`. This can be obtained using the `shape` attribute of the NumPy array, which returns a tuple (rows, columns). The first element of this tuple gives `n_x`.\n2. **Fixed Hidden Layer Size (n_h)**: As per the problem statement, the hidden layer size is fixed at 10, so `n_h` will always be 10.\n3. **Extract Output Units (n_y)**: The number of output units is determined by the number of rows in the output matrix `Y`, similar to how `n_x` was obtained.

For example, if `X` has a shape of (5, 100), then `n_x` is 5, indicating there are 5 input features per example.\n- **n_h**: The hidden layer size is fixed at 10, as specified in the problem statement. This value is constant regardless of the input or output dimensions.\n- **n_y**: The number of output units is derived from the number of rows in matrix `Y`.

That's a typo. The correct key should be 'ev_estimates'. Let's fix that.\n\nAlso, the code should handle the case where the policy's `ev_estimates` is present but empty.

{"task_id": 91, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the backward pass for the ReLU activation function in a neural network. The ReLU activation function is defined as \\( \\text{ReLU}(z) = \\max(0, z) \\), and its gradient during backpropagation is straightforward: the gradient is passed through if the input was positive during the forward pass, otherwise it is zero.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Input Shapes**: First, we need to ensure that the upstream gradient `dA` and the cached pre-activation values `Z` (stored in `activation_cache`) have the same shape. If they don't, we return -1 as specified.\n2. **Convert to NumPy Arrays**: Convert both `dA` and `activation_cache` from Python lists to NumPy arrays to leverage vectorized operations.\n3. **Compute Gradient**: The gradient of the loss with respect to `Z` (denoted as `dZ`) is computed by multiplying the upstream gradient `dA` element-wise with an indicator matrix where each element is 1 if the corresponding element in `Z` was positive during the forward pass, and 0 otherwise.\n4. **Convert Back to List**: Convert the resulting NumPy array `dZ` back to a Python list of lists before returning it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef relu_backward(dA: list[list[int | float]], activation_cache: list[list[int | float]]) -> list[list[int | float]]:\n    \"\"\"Backward pass of the ReLU activation function.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    dA : list[list[int | float]]\n        Upstream gradient from the next layer in the network.\n    activation_cache : list[list[int | float]]\n        Cached pre-activation values (Z) from the forward pass.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    list[list[int | float]]\n        Gradient with respect to Z, having the same shape as *dA*.\n        Returns -1 if *dA* and *activation_cache* do not share the same shape.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert inputs to numpy arrays\n    dA_np = np.array(dA)\n    Z_np = np.array(activation_cache)\n    \n    # Check if shapes are the same\n    if dA_np.shape != Z_np.shape:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Compute the gradient dZ\n    dZ_np = dA_np * (Z_np > 0)\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return dZ_np.tolist()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Conversion**: The function starts by converting the input lists `dA` and `activation_cache` into NumPy arrays `dA_np` and `Z_np` respectively. This allows us to perform efficient element-wise operations.\n2. **Shape Check**: The shapes of `dA_np` and `Z_np` are compared. If they differ, the function returns -1 immediately, indicating an error condition.\n3. **Gradient Calculation**: The gradient `dZ` is computed by multiplying the upstream gradient `dA_np` with a binary mask derived from `Z_np`. The mask is 1 where elements of `Z_np` are positive and 0 otherwise. This operation efficiently implements the ReLU gradient rule.\n4. **Output Conversion**: The resulting gradient `dZ_np` (a NumPy array) is converted back to a Python list of lists using the `tolist()` method before being returned, ensuring the output meets the specified format.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the ReLU backward pass using vectorized operations, ensuring both correctness and performance.

{"task_id": 92, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given input value is numeric, excluding boolean values. The solution involves checking if the input is an instance of `numbers.Number` but not an instance of `bool`. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Numeric Type**: The input value should be an instance of `numbers.Number`. This includes types like `int`, `float`, `complex`, and other numeric types from the `numbers` module.\n2. **Exclude Boolean Values**: Although booleans (`True` and `False`) are technically a subclass of `int` in Python, they should not be considered numeric for this task. Therefore, we need to explicitly check that the input is not an instance of `bool`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numbers\n\ndef is_number(a) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check whether the input value is numeric.\n\n    A value is considered numeric if it is an instance of ``numbers.Number``\n    (int, float, complex, Fraction, Decimal, etc.) but **not** a boolean.\n\n    Args:\n        a: Any Python object.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if ``a`` is numeric and not a bool, otherwise False.\n    \"\"\"\n    return isinstance(a, numbers.Number) and not isinstance(a, bool)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Checking Numeric Type**: The function uses `isinstance(a, numbers.Number)` to verify if the input `a` is an instance of any numeric type. This check covers all standard numeric types, including those from the `numbers` module (like `Fraction` and `Decimal`), as well as built-in types like `int`, `float`, and `complex`.\n2. **Excluding Booleans**: The function then checks that `a` is not an instance of `bool` using `not isinstance(a, bool)`. This is crucial because in Python, `True` and `False` are instances of `int` (due to historical reasons), but they should not be treated as numeric values in this context.\n3. **Combining Conditions**: The function returns `True` only if both conditions are met: the input is a numeric type and not a boolean. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThis approach efficiently distinguishes between numeric values and booleans while accommodating all other numeric types in Python."}

This step ensures that whether `Z` is a scalar, list, or already a NumPy array, it is treated uniformly as a NumPy array.\n2. **ReLU Computation**: The ReLU activation is computed using `np.maximum(0, Z_array)`, which efficiently applies the element-wise maximum operation between zero and each element in `Z_array`. This operation is vectorized, meaning it avoids explicit loops and leverages NumPy's optimized C-based backend for performance.\n3. **Conversion to Lists**: The results (both the activation `A` and the original input `Z_array`) are converted to Python lists using the `tolist()` method.

This helps in calculating probabilities later.\n3. **Target Sentence Processing**: Words in the target sentence not found in the vocabulary are replaced with \"<UNK>\".\n4. **Probability Calculation**: For each N-gram in the processed target sentence, the smoothed probability is computed using the formula provided. The numerator is the count of the N-gram plus K, and the denominator is the count of the context plus K multiplied by the vocabulary size.\n5. **Log-Probability Summation**: The log of each N-gram's probability is summed up. If the sentence is shorter than N, the function returns 0.0. The final result is rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles N-gram modeling with additive smoothing, ensuring robust probability estimates even for unseen words or contexts."}

This handles nested lists seamlessly.\n3. **Compute Derivative**: Apply the ReLU derivative condition (1 if element > 0, else 0) to each element in the array.\n4. **Return Result in Appropriate Format**: \n   - If the input was a scalar, return a float (0.0 or 1.0).\n   - For non-scalar inputs, convert the result back to a list (or nested lists) using the `tolist()` method of the NumPy array, which preserves the original structure.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef drelu(Z):\n    \"\"\"Return the element-wise derivative of the ReLU activation.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    Z : int | float | list | numpy.ndarray\n        Input data that can be a scalar, list (any depth), or ndarray.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    float | list\n        Derivative of ReLU with the same shape layout as *Z* (float if *Z* is a scalar).\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(Z, (int, float)):\n        return 1.0 if Z > 0 else 0.0\n    else:\n        # Convert to numpy array if it's not already\n        arr = np.array(Z)\n        # Compute the derivative\n        derivative = (arr > 0).astype(float)\n        # Return as a list with the same structure as input\n        return derivative.tolist()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The function first checks if the input `Z` is a scalar (int or float). If so, it directly returns 1.0 if the scalar is greater than 0, otherwise 0.0.\n2. **Non-scalar Inputs**: For non-scalar inputs (lists or ndarrays), the input is converted into a NumPy array. This allows us to leverage NumPy's vectorized operations for efficient computation.\n3. **Derivative Calculation**: The derivative is computed by checking each element in the array to see if it is greater than 0. The result is a boolean array which is then cast to float (True becomes 1.0, False becomes 0.0).\n4. **Output Conversion**: The resulting NumPy array is converted back to a Python list (or nested lists) using the `tolist()` method, which matches the original input structure. This ensures that the output maintains the same dimensional layout as the input.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all specified input types and returns the derivative in the required format, whether it's a scalar float or a nested list structure."}

The sum of this boolean array gives the total number of mismatches.\n4. **Error Rate Calculation**: The error rate is computed by dividing the number of mismatches by the total number of samples. The result is then rounded to four decimal places using Python's built-in `round` function to meet the specified precision requirement.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the task by leveraging NumPy's capabilities for clean and concise code, ensuring correctness and performance."}

The coefficient \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\sigma} \\) is calculated once, and the exponent term is computed for each element in the array. The results are then multiplied element-wise.\n5. **Rounding and Conversion**: Each computed PDF value is rounded to five decimal places and converted into a list, which is then returned. This meets the requirement of returning a list of rounded floats.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all specified input types and edge cases while ensuring accurate computation and proper rounding of the Gaussian PDF values."}
{"task_id": 107, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a single optimization step of the Adam algorithm. The Adam algorithm is an adaptive learning rate optimization method that computes individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters from estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Update the first moment estimate (m_t)**: This is an exponential moving average of the gradient, combining the previous moment estimate (m_prev) and the current gradient (grad) using the hyperparameter beta1.\n2. **Update the second moment estimate (v_t)**: This is an exponential moving average of the squared gradient, combining the previous second moment estimate (v_prev) and the element-wise square of the current gradient (grad**2) using the hyperparameter beta2.\n3. **Bias correction for the first and second moments**: Since the initial moments are biased towards zero, especially in the initial time steps, we correct this bias by dividing each moment by (1 - beta^t), where t is the current time step.\n4. **Update the parameters (theta)**: The parameters are updated using the bias-corrected moments. The update involves scaling the learning rate (alpha) by the bias-corrected first moment divided by the square root of the bias-corrected second moment plus a small constant (epsilon) for numerical stability.\n5. **Increment the time step (t)**: The time step is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.\n6. **Round the results**: All floating-point values in the updated parameters, moments, and the new time step are rounded to 6 decimal places before returning.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef adam_step(theta: np.ndarray,\n              grad: np.ndarray,\n              m_prev: np.ndarray,\n              v_prev: np.ndarray,\n              t: int,\n              alpha: float = 0.01,\n              beta1: float = 0.9,\n              beta2: float = 0.99,\n              epsilon: float = 1e-9) -> tuple[list, list, list, int]:\n    \"\"\"Perform one iteration of the Adam optimisation algorithm.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    theta : np.ndarray\n        Current parameter values.\n    grad : np.ndarray\n        Gradient of the loss with respect to *theta*.\n    m_prev : np.ndarray\n        First moment vector from the previous time step.\n    v_prev : np.ndarray\n        Second moment vector from the previous time step.\n    t : int\n        Current time-step counter (starting at 1).\n    alpha : float, optional\n        Learning rate.

Similarly, the second moment (v_t) is updated using the squared gradient, weighted by beta2 and (1 - beta2).\n2. **Bias Correction**: The bias-corrected moments (m_hat_t and v_hat_t) are computed by dividing the moments by (1 - beta^t), where t is the current time step. This adjustment counters the initial bias towards zero in the early steps.\n3. **Parameter Update**: The parameters (theta) are updated by moving in the direction of the negative gradient, scaled by the learning rate (alpha) and divided by the square root of the bias-corrected second moment (v_hat_t), with a small constant (epsilon) added to avoid division by zero.\n4. **Rounding and Conversion**: The updated parameters and moments are rounded to six decimal places and converted to Python lists to meet the output constraints. The time step is incremented by 1 and returned as part of the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently implements the Adam optimization step, ensuring numerical stability and precision through bias correction and careful handling of floating-point values."}

The regex `r'[a-zA-Z]+'` will match these sequences.\n2. **Normalize Words**: Convert each extracted word to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparison.\n3. **Count Frequencies**: Use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each normalized word.\n4. **Sort Words**: Sort the words first by descending frequency and then lexicographically (alphabetical order) for words with the same frequency.\n5. **Create Token Objects**: For each word in the sorted list, create a Token object, set its `word` attribute to the lowercase word, and its `count` attribute to the frequency.\n6. **Handle Edge Cases**: If no words are found in the input text, return an empty list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Token:\n    def __init__(self, word):\n        self.count = 0\n        self.word = word\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return \"Token(word='{}', count={})\".format(self.word, self.count)\n\ndef tokenize_and_count(text: str) -> list[Token]:\n    \"\"\"Convert *text* into a list of Token objects with their frequencies.\n\n    Your task:\n      1.

This effectively splits the text into words while ignoring any non-alphabetic characters.\n2. **Normalization**: Each extracted word is converted to lowercase to ensure that the frequency count is case-insensitive. For example, \"Cat\" and \"cat\" are treated as the same word.\n3. **Counting Frequencies**: The `Counter` class is used to count occurrences of each normalized word. This provides a dictionary-like structure where keys are words and values are their counts.\n4. **Sorting**: The items (word-count pairs) are sorted by descending frequency (primary key) and lexicographical order of the words (secondary key). The sorting is done using a lambda function that sorts by negative count (to get descending order) and then by the word itself.\n5. **Creating Tokens**: For each sorted word-count pair, a Token object is created.

The MSE for the split is the average of the squared differences between each target value in the split and this mean. The weighted contribution of each split's MSE to the total child MSE is determined by multiplying the split's MSE by the fraction of samples it contains relative to the parent node.\n3. **MSE Reduction**: The reduction in MSE is the difference between the parent MSE and the sum of the weighted child MSEs.

The gradient is computed as \\((1/m) \\cdot X^T (Xw - y)\\), where m is the number of samples.\n5. **Return the Weights**: After completing all iterations, round the weights to four decimal places and return them as a list with the bias term first.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef linear_regression(X: list[list[int | float]],\n                      y: list[int | float],\n                      n_iterations: int,\n                      learning_rate: float) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Learn linear regression weights with batch gradient descent.\n\n    Args:\n        X: Training samples \u2013 list of lists with numerical feature values.\n        y: Target values \u2013 list of numbers, same length as X.\n        n_iterations: Number of gradient-descent steps to perform.\n        learning_rate: Positive learning rate controlling the step size.\n\n    Returns:\n        The learned weight vector as a list (bias first) rounded to 4 decimals.\n        If the input dimensions are incompatible the function must return -1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert inputs to numpy arrays for easier manipulation\n    X_np = np.array(X)\n    y_np = np.array(y)\n    \n    # Check if the number of samples in X and y match\n    if X_np.shape[0] != len(y_np):\n        return -1\n    \n    # Insert a column of 1s at the beginning of X for the bias term\n    m = X_np.shape[0]\n    X_augmented = np.column_stack([np.ones(m), X_np])\n    \n    # Number of features including the bias term\n    N = X_augmented.shape[1]\n    \n    # Initialize weights uniformly in [-1/sqrt(N), 1/sqrt(N)]\n    lower = -1.0 / math.sqrt(N)\n    upper = 1.0 / math.sqrt(N)\n    w = np.random.uniform(lower, upper, N)\n    \n    # Perform batch gradient descent\n    for _ in range(n_iterations):\n        # Compute the gradient: (1/m) * X^T (Xw - y)\n        gradient = (1.0 / m) * X_augmented.T @ (X_augmented @ w - y_np)\n        # Update weights\n        w -= learning_rate * gradient\n    \n    # Round the weights to 4 decimal places and convert to a list\n    rounded_weights = [round(weight, 4) for weight in w]\n    \n    return rounded_weights\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Compatibility Check**: The code first checks if the number of rows in X matches the length of y. If not, it returns -1 immediately.\n2. **Design Matrix Augmentation**: The design matrix X is augmented by adding a column of 1's at the beginning to incorporate the bias term in the linear regression model.\n3. **Weight Initialization**: The weights are initialized from a uniform distribution between \\([-1/\\sqrt{N}, 1/\\sqrt{N}]\\), where N is the number of features including the bias term. This initialization helps in starting the gradient descent from a reasonable range.\n4. **Gradient Descent**: For each iteration, the gradient of the MSE is computed. The weights are updated by moving in the opposite direction of the gradient scaled by the learning rate. This process minimizes the MSE over the iterations.\n5. **Result Preparation**: After completing all iterations, the weights are rounded to four decimal places and returned as a list, with the bias term (the first weight) followed by the feature weights.\n\nThis approach efficiently implements batch gradient descent for linear regression, ensuring numerical stability and correctness through careful initialization and gradient computation."}

These values can be integers, strings, or other types, but they need to be sorted in ascending or alphabetical order.\n2. **Sort Categories**: Sort the unique categories to ensure a consistent order.

This dictionary will help in quickly determining the position of each element in the input array.\n4. **Generate One-Hot Encoded Matrix**: For each element in the input array, create a binary vector (a list of 0s and 1s) where the position corresponding to the element's category is set to 1, and all other positions are set to 0.

This meets the requirement of returning a standard Python list.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging Python's built-in itertools functions to manage the infinite cycling and slicing operations, ensuring optimal performance and correctness."}

{"task_id": 131, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to write a function that retrieves an element from a specific sequence in a shared container, handling potential errors gracefully by returning `None` when the indices are invalid. The solution involves checking the validity of both the sequence identifier (`uid`) and the element index (`i`) within the sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check the validity of `uid`**: The `uid` must be a valid index for the global list `_SHARED_SEQUENCES`. This means:\n   - `uid` should be a non-negative integer less than the length of `_SHARED_SEQUENCES`.\n   - If `uid` is negative or exceeds the list bounds, return `None`.\n2. **Check the validity of `i` in the selected sequence**: Once a valid sequence is identified, check if the index `i` is valid for that sequence. Python lists handle negative indices by counting from the end, so:\n   - The absolute value of `i` should be less than the length of the sequence. For example, in a list of length 3, valid indices are -3 to 2.\n   - If `i` is out of bounds, return `None`.\n3. **Return the element if all checks pass**: If both indices are valid, return the element at position `i` in the sequence identified by `uid`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef get_index(uid: int, i: int):\n    \"\"\"Return the element at position *i* of the sequence identified by *uid*.\n\n    The global list ``_SHARED_SEQUENCES`` contains every available sequence so\n    that several parts of a program can work on different sequences at the\n    same time.\n\n    If *uid* or *i* is invalid the function must return *None* instead of\n    raising an exception.\n\n    Args:\n        uid: Integer identifier of the desired sequence.\n        i:   Position inside the selected sequence (supports negative indices).\n\n    Returns:\n        The requested element, or None if the access is invalid.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        sequence = _SHARED_SEQUENCES[uid]\n    except (IndexError, TypeError):\n        return None\n    \n    try:\n        return sequence[i]\n    except IndexError:\n        return None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Checking `uid` Validity**: The function first attempts to access the sequence at index `uid` in `_SHARED_SEQUENCES`. If `uid` is out of bounds (either negative or too large) or not an integer (though the type hint suggests it should be an integer), an `IndexError` or `TypeError` will be raised, and the function catches these exceptions to return `None`.\n2. **Checking `i` Validity**: If the sequence is successfully retrieved, the function then attempts to access the element at index `i` in this sequence. If `i` is out of bounds (after considering negative indices), an `IndexError` is caught, and the function returns `None`.\n3. **Returning the Element**: If both checks pass, the element at the specified position is returned. This approach ensures that any invalid access, whether to the sequence or the element within it, gracefully returns `None` without raising exceptions, thus adhering to the problem constraints.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the error cases while providing the desired element when the indices are valid, ensuring the global list remains unchanged."}

If so, return it directly.\n2. **Handle Non-Scalar Inputs**: For inputs that are lists or tuples, convert them into a NumPy ndarray.

If any index is found outside this range, return -1 immediately.\n2. **One-Hot Encoding**: For valid inputs, create a 3-D list where each element in the original 2-D list is converted into a one-hot vector.

If any token is found to be negative or greater than or equal to the vocabulary length, the function returns -1 immediately, indicating an invalid input.\n2. **One-Hot Encoding**: For valid inputs, the function initializes an empty list to hold the 3-D one-hot encoded result. For each token in each sequence, it creates a zero vector of length equal to the vocabulary size. The position corresponding to the token's value is set to 1, converting the token into its one-hot representation. This process is repeated for all tokens in all sequences, building the 3-D structure layer by layer.\n3. **Return Result**: The resulting 3-D list is returned, which can be directly converted into a NumPy array if needed, suitable for use in deep learning frameworks like Keras.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both the validation of input indices and the transformation into the required one-hot encoded format, ensuring correctness and compatibility with deep learning workflows."}

The softmax function converts raw scores into probabilities by exponentiating each element, but to avoid numerical instability (overflow or underflow), we subtract the maximum value along the specified axis before exponentiation. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Subtract the Maximum Value**: For numerical stability, we first find the maximum value along the specified axis and subtract it from each element. This step ensures that the largest value in the array becomes zero, which helps in preventing overflow when exponentiating.\n2. **Exponentiation**: After shifting the values by the maximum, we exponentiate each element. This results in all values being non-negative, with the largest original value becoming 1 (since e^0 = 1).\n3. **Normalization**: We then normalize these exponentiated values by dividing each element by the sum of the exponentiated values along the specified axis. This ensures that the values sum to 1, forming a valid probability distribution.\n4. **Rounding and Conversion**: Finally, we round each probability to four decimal places and convert the resulting NumPy array into a Python list using the `tolist()` method.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef softmax(z: np.ndarray, axis: int = -1) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Compute the numerically-stable softmax of *z* along *axis*.\n\n    The function should:\n    1.

This step is crucial to prevent numerical overflow during the subsequent exponentiation step. For example, if the input array is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], subtracting the maximum value 3.0 results in [-2.0, -1.0, 0.0].\n2. **Exponentiation**: Each element in the shifted array is exponentiated.

The agent can only move to cells that are not on fire at the time of arrival. The solution involves calculating the time each cell catches fire and then performing a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path for the agent, ensuring that the agent's path does not enter any cell that is or will be on fire at the time of arrival.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Initial Conditions**: \n   - If the start cell (0, 0) or the goal cell (n-1, n-1) is on fire at time 0, return -1 immediately.\n   - If the maze is 1x1 and the cell is free, return 0 since the agent is already at the goal.\n\n2. **Precompute Fire Spread Times**:\n   - Use BFS to compute the earliest time each cell catches fire. This involves initializing a queue with all initial fire positions (marked 'F') and then spreading the fire to adjacent cells each minute. The fire spreads to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that are not walls and not already on fire.\n\n3. **BFS for Agent's Path**:\n   - Perform another BFS to explore the agent's possible paths. The agent can move to adjacent cells only if the cell is not a wall, not on fire at the current time, and will not catch fire before or at the time the agent arrives.

If the maze is a single free cell, it returns 0 immediately.\n2. **Fire Spread Calculation**: Using BFS, the function calculates the earliest time each cell catches fire. This helps in determining safe paths for the agent.\n3. **Agent's Path BFS**: The agent's BFS checks each adjacent cell to ensure it's not a wall, not visited, and not on fire at the arrival time. The goal cell is checked separately to ensure it's safe upon arrival, even if it catches fire at the same time the agent arrives (since the agent moves after the fire spreads).\n4. **Termination Conditions**: The BFS returns the time taken if the agent reaches the goal. If the queue is exhausted without reaching the goal, it returns -1, indicating no safe path exists.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the dynamic nature of the fire spread and ensures the agent's path is both optimal and safe."}

This ensures that subsequent operations are performed on a NumPy array.\n2. **Forward Activation (Leaky ReLU)**: For each element in the input array, if the element is greater than or equal to zero, keep it as is. If the element is negative, multiply it by a small positive slope `alpha` (default 0.2).\n3. **Backward Propagation (Derivative)**: For each element in the input array, if the element is greater than or equal to zero, the derivative is 1. If the element is negative, the derivative is `alpha`.\n4. **Vectorized Operations**: Use NumPy's vectorized operations to apply the conditions element-wise, which avoids explicit loops and leverages NumPy's optimized C-based operations for performance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef leaky_relu(x, alpha: float = 0.2, derivative: bool = False):\n    \"\"\"Compute the Leaky ReLU activation or its derivative.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : numpy.ndarray | list | tuple\n        Input data of arbitrary shape.

Again using `np.where`, it checks each element of `x`; if the element is greater than or equal to zero, it returns the element unchanged, otherwise it returns the element multiplied by `alpha`.\n4. **Vectorized Operations**: The use of `np.where` ensures that the operations are applied element-wise across the entire array without explicit loops, making the computation efficient and concise.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both the forward and backward passes of the Leaky ReLU activation function, leveraging NumPy's optimized operations for performance and correctness."}

Then, for each subsequent data point, compute the smoothed value using the formula \\( s_k = (1 - \\alpha) \\times s_{k-1} + \\alpha \\times x_k \\).\n4. **Round Results**:\n   - Each computed smoothed value should be rounded to four decimal places before being added to the result list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef exp_smoothing(data: List[float], alpha: float) -> List[float] | int:\n    \"\"\"Compute the exponential moving average of a numeric sequence.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    data : List[float]\n        Sequence of numeric observations.\n    alpha : float\n        Smoothing factor (0 \u2264 alpha \u2264 1).\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    List[float] | int\n        List of smoothed values rounded to 4 decimal places, or -1 for\n        invalid input.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not data or alpha < 0 or alpha > 1:\n        return -1\n    \n    if alpha == 0:\n        return [round(data[0], 4) for _ in data]\n    elif alpha == 1:\n        return [round(x, 4) for x in data]\n    \n    smoothed = []\n    s_prev = data[0]\n    smoothed.append(round(s_prev, 4))\n    \n    for x in data[1:]:\n        s_prev = (1 - alpha) * s_prev + alpha * x\n        smoothed.append(round(s_prev, 4))\n    \n    return smoothed\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input list is empty or if the alpha value is outside the valid range [0, 1].

This operation is a standard linear transformation (affine transformation).\n3. **ReLU Activation**: The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied to the result of the first linear transformation. ReLU sets all negative values to zero, introducing non-linearity.\n4. **Second Linear Transformation**: The output from the first ReLU activation is processed through another linear transformation using weights `W2` and bias `b2`.\n5. **Second ReLU Activation**: Another ReLU activation is applied to the result of the second linear transformation.\n6. **Output Linear Transformation**: The result from the second ReLU activation undergoes a final linear transformation using weights `W3` and bias `b3`.\n7. **Tanh Activation**: The tanh (hyperbolic tangent) function is applied to the result of the output linear transformation, ensuring the output values are within the range [-1, 1].\n8. **Rounding and Conversion**: The resulting action vector is rounded to four decimal places and converted to a Python list before being returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently follows the specified network architecture, leveraging NumPy for matrix operations and activation functions, ensuring the solution is both concise and correct."}

The accuracy score is defined as the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of samples.

If they are, it returns -1 as specified.\n2. **Empty Containers**: If both containers are empty (checked by verifying that both have zero length), the function returns 0 because there are no samples to evaluate.\n3. **Count Matches**: The function iterates through each corresponding pair of elements in `y_true` and `y_pred`, counting how many times they match. This is done using a generator expression inside the `sum` function for efficiency.\n4. **Compute and Round Accuracy**: The accuracy is calculated by dividing the number of matches by the total number of samples (length of `y_true`). The result is then rounded to 4 decimal places using Python's built-in `round` function before returning.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all specified cases and ensures the result is formatted correctly, providing a robust implementation of the accuracy score metric."}

The solution involves several steps: clipping the predicted probabilities to avoid undefined logarithm values, computing the log-loss for each sample, and then averaging these values while rounding the result to six decimal places.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Clipping Probabilities**: The predicted probabilities should be clipped to a small interval \\([\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]\\) where \\(\\varepsilon = 10^{-15}\\). This prevents taking the logarithm of zero or one, which would result in undefined values or infinite loss.\n2. **Logarithm Calculation**: For each sample, compute the log-loss using the formula \\(-\\left[y_i \\log(p_i) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - p_i)\\right]\\), where \\(y_i\\) is the actual label (0 or 1) and \\(p_i\\) is the clipped predicted probability.\n3. **Average Log-Loss**: Sum the individual log-loss values for all samples and divide by the number of samples to get the average log-loss.\n4. **Rounding**: Round the result to six decimal places before returning it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_log_loss(actual, predicted):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the binary classification log-loss (cross-entropy loss) between actual labels and predicted probabilities.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    actual (array-like): Ground-truth labels (0 or 1).\n    predicted (array-like): Predicted probabilities for the positive class (between 0 and 1).\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The average log-loss rounded to six decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    epsilon = 1e-15\n    # Clip predicted probabilities to avoid log(0) or log(1)\n    predicted_clipped = np.clip(predicted, epsilon, 1 - epsilon)\n    \n    # Convert actual to numpy array if it's not already\n    actual = np.array(actual)\n    predicted_clipped = np.array(predicted_clipped)\n    \n    # Compute the log-loss components\n    loss_per_sample = - (actual * np.log(predicted_clipped) + (1 - actual) * np.log(1 - predicted_clipped))\n    \n    # Average the loss\n    average_loss = np.mean(loss_per_sample)\n    \n    # Round to six decimal places\n    return round(average_loss, 6)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Clipping Probabilities**: The `np.clip` function ensures that all predicted probabilities are within the interval \\([10^{-15}, 1 - 10^{-15}]\\).

The formula effectively penalizes incorrect predictions more heavily when the predicted probability is far from the actual label.\n3. **Average and Rounding**: The individual log-loss values are averaged across all samples, and the result is rounded to six decimal places to meet the specified output constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the computation while ensuring numerical stability and precision, providing a reliable metric for evaluating binary classification models."}

The solution should handle both Python lists and NumPy arrays, check for equal lengths, and return the result rounded to four decimal places or -1 if the lengths differ.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Lengths**: First, we need to verify that the two input vectors have the same length. If they don't, we return -1 immediately.\n2. **Convert to NumPy Arrays**: To handle both lists and NumPy arrays uniformly, we can convert the inputs into NumPy arrays. This allows us to leverage NumPy's efficient vectorized operations.\n3. **Compute Differences**: Using NumPy's element-wise comparison, we can find the positions where the elements of the two vectors differ.\n4. **Sum Differences**: The sum of these differences (where each difference is treated as 1 if elements differ and 0 otherwise) gives the total number of differing positions.\n5. **Normalize and Round**: Divide this sum by the length of the vectors to get the normalized Hamming distance, then round the result to four decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef hamming_distance(x: list[int] | \"np.ndarray\", y: list[int] | \"np.ndarray\") -> float | int:\n    \"\"\"Compute the normalized Hamming distance between two equal-length integer vectors.\n\n    The distance is the proportion of indices at which the corresponding\n    elements are different.

This ensures that subsequent operations are performed uniformly.\n2. **Length Check**: The function checks if the lengths of the two arrays are different. If they are, it returns -1 immediately, as specified.\n3. **Difference Calculation**: Using NumPy's vectorized operations, the function computes the element-wise inequality between the two arrays (`x_arr != y_arr`), which results in a boolean array. Summing this array gives the total number of differing elements.\n4. **Normalization and Rounding**: The sum of differences is divided by the length of the arrays to normalize the Hamming distance between 0 and 1.

The solution involves computing this derivative element-wise and handling different input types appropriately.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Check if the input is a scalar (a single number) or a list/array. Convert the input into a NumPy array if it is a list to facilitate vectorized operations.\n2. **Computation**: Use NumPy's `tanh` function to compute the hyperbolic tangent of each element in the input, then apply the derivative formula \\( 1 - \\tanh^2(z) \\).\n3. **Rounding**: Round each result to four decimal places.\n4. **Output Handling**: If the original input was a scalar, return the result as a float.

If they do not, we return -1 immediately.\n2. **Handle Empty Strings**: If both strings are empty, the distance is 0 because there are no characters to compare.\n3. **Calculate ASCII Differences**: For each corresponding pair of characters in the candidate and target strings, compute the absolute difference of their ASCII values and sum these differences to get the total alphabetical distance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef alphabetical_distance(candidate: str, target: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Calculate the alphabetical distance between two equal-length strings.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    candidate : str\n        The string produced by the genetic algorithm.\n    target : str\n        The desired target string.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    int\n        The sum of absolute ASCII differences between corresponding\n        characters.

If they are not equal, the function returns -1, adhering to the first rule.\n2. **Initialize Distance**: The variable `distance` is initialized to 0. This variable will accumulate the sum of absolute ASCII differences between corresponding characters.\n3. **Iterate Through Characters**: Using a loop, the function iterates over each pair of corresponding characters from the candidate and target strings. For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference between their ASCII values using the `ord` function and adds this difference to `distance`.\n4. **Return Result**: After processing all character pairs, the accumulated `distance` is returned. If both strings are empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns 0, which is correct as per the problem statement.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the necessary conditions and computes the alphabetical distance in a straightforward manner, ensuring correctness and adherence to the specified rules."}

The discriminator's predictions are given as soft-max probabilities, and the labels are one-hot encoded. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss**: This loss is calculated by taking the negative log of the predicted probabilities for the true classes, averaged over all samples in the mini-batch. The formula for the loss for a single sample is \\(-\\sum_{i} y_i \\log(p_i)\\), where \\(y_i\\) is the one-hot encoded label and \\(p_i\\) is the predicted probability. The average loss over the mini-batch is then computed.\n2. **Accuracy**: The accuracy is the proportion of correctly classified samples in the mini-batch.

Incorrectly classified samples get higher weights.\n   - **Normalize Weights**: Ensure the weights sum to 1 for the next round.\n3. **Early Stopping**: If a perfect stump (error = 0) is found, stop training early.\n4. **Prediction**: For each test sample, aggregate the predictions of all stumps weighted by their alpha values and convert the aggregated result into a class label (0 or 1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef adaboost_predict(X_train: list[list[int | float]],\n                     y_train: list[int],\n                     X_test: list[list[int | float]],\n                     n_estimators: int = 10) -> list[int]:\n    # Convert input lists to numpy arrays for easier manipulation\n    X_train = np.array(X_train)\n    y_train = np.array(y_train)\n    X_test = np.array(X_test)\n    \n    n_samples, n_features = X_train.shape\n    \n    # Initialize sample weights uniformly\n    weights = np.ones(n_samples) / n_samples\n    \n    # List to store the weak learners (stumps) and their alphas\n    stumps = []\n    alphas = []\n    \n    for _ in range(n_estimators):\n        # Find the best stump (feature, threshold, polarity) with minimal weighted error\n        best_error = float('inf')\n        best_feature = None\n        best_threshold = None\n        best_polarity = None\n        best_pred = None\n        \n        # Iterate over each feature to find the best threshold and polarity\n        for feature_idx in range(n_features):\n            feature_values = X_train[:, feature_idx]\n            unique_values = np.unique(feature_values)\n            thresholds = (unique_values[:-1] + unique_values[1:]) / 2 if len(unique_values) > 1 else [unique_values[0]]\n            \n            for threshold in thresholds:\n                for polarity in [1, -1]:\n                    # Predict based on current feature, threshold, and polarity\n                    if polarity == 1:\n                        pred = np.where(feature_values < threshold, 1, -1)\n                    else:\n                        pred = np.where(feature_values >= threshold, 1, -1)\n                    \n                    # Convert y_train to -1 and 1 for calculations\n                    y_converted = np.where(y_train == 1, 1, -1)\n                    \n                    # Calculate weighted error\n                    incorrect = (pred != y_converted)\n                    weighted_error = np.sum(weights * incorrect)\n                    \n                    # Check if this is the best error so far, with tie-breaking\n                    if (weighted_error < best_error) or \\\n                       (weighted_error == best_error and feature_idx < best_feature) or \\\n                       (weighted_error == best_error and feature_idx == best_feature and threshold < best_threshold) or \\\n                       (weighted_error == best_error and feature_idx == best_feature and threshold == best_threshold and polarity > best_polarity):\n                        best_error = weighted_error\n                        best_feature = feature_idx\n                        best_threshold = threshold\n                        best_polarity = polarity\n                        best_pred = pred\n        \n        # Early stopping if error is zero\n        if best_error <= 1e-10:\n            # Compute alpha for this perfect stump\n            alpha = 0.5 * np.log((1.0 -

The best stump is selected based on the lowest error, with tie-breaking rules ensuring determinism.\n3. **Alpha Calculation**: The weight (alpha) of each stump is computed based on its error. A lower error results in a higher alpha, giving more influence to more accurate stumps in the final prediction.\n4. **Weight Update**: Sample weights are updated to focus more on misclassified samples in subsequent rounds, ensuring the algorithm adapts to difficult cases.\n5. **Prediction**: The final prediction is a weighted vote of all stumps. The sign of the aggregated votes determines the class label (0 or 1).\n\nThis approach efficiently combines multiple weak learners to form a strong classifier, leveraging the iterative weight adjustment mechanism of AdaBoost to improve classification performance."}

The return type should be a scalar float for scalar inputs and a Python list (or nested list) for non-scalar inputs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Handle Different Input Types**: The input can be a scalar (int or float), a list (possibly nested), or a NumPy array. We need to process each type appropriately.\n2. **Convert Input to NumPy Array**: For non-scalar inputs, converting the input into a NumPy array simplifies the computation, as NumPy can handle operations on arrays efficiently.\n3. **Compute tanh for Each Element**: The tanh function is defined as (e^z - e^(-z)) / (e^z + e^(-z)). We will compute this for each element in the input.\n4. **Round Results**: Each computed tanh value should be rounded to 4 decimal places.\n5. **Return Appropriate Type**: If the input was a scalar, return a single float.

The result is then rounded to 4 decimal places and returned as a float.\n2. **Non-Scalar Handling**: For lists or NumPy arrays, the input is first converted into a NumPy array to leverage vectorized operations. The tanh values are computed element-wise using the same formula. The results are rounded to 4 decimal places and converted back to a Python list (or nested list) using the `.tolist()` method to ensure the output matches the input structure.\n3. **Vectorized Operations**: By using NumPy's vectorized operations, the function efficiently processes each element in the input array without explicit loops, which is both concise and performant.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function handles all specified input types correctly, computes the tanh values accurately, and returns the results in the required format with precise rounding."}

So that's correct.\n\nAlso, the function's docstring has a typo: \"num_iterations\" is misspelled as \"num_iterations\". But that doesn't affect the code's functionality.\n\nThe code should now be correct. Let me test it with some sample inputs.\n\nFor example, if n_dims=2, num_particles=10, num_iterations=100, seed=1, the function should return a value close to 0 (the minimum of the Sphere function is 0 at x_i = 0 for all i).\n\nRunning the function with these parameters might return a small value like 0.0001 or similar, rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThus, the code is ready. The key steps are:\n\n1. Check for invalid inputs.\n2. Initialize the RNG with the given seed.\n3. Set up the PSO parameters (w, c1, c2, bounds).\n4. Initialize particle positions and velocities.\n5. Initialize personal and global bests.\n6. In each iteration, update velocities and positions for each particle, then evaluate new positions and update bests.\n7. After all iterations, return the best value found, rounded to four decimals.\n\nThe code handles all the steps correctly, including clipping positions to the bounds and using the RNG for random numbers. The velocity update formula is correctly implemented with the inertia, cognitive, and social components. The global best is updated whenever a particle finds a better position. The function returns the best value found, rounded to four decimal places."}

The `strip()` method then removes any leading or trailing spaces from the resulting string.\n5. **Empty String Check**: If the processed string is empty (either because it was empty after preprocessing or became empty during processing), the function returns an empty list.\n6. **Character Tokenization**: The processed string is converted into a list of characters using the `list()` constructor, which splits the string into individual characters, and this list is returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the preprocessing steps and ensures the output meets the specified requirements, providing a robust character-level tokenizer."}

{"task_id": 183, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the He (Kaiming) uniform initialization for neural network weights. The initialization depends on the fan-in (number of incoming connections) of the layer, which varies based on whether the layer is a dense (fully-connected) layer or a 2-D convolutional layer. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Determine the fan-in (n_in)**: \n   - For a dense layer, the weight matrix has shape `(n_in, n_out)`, so the fan-in is the first dimension.\n   - For a 2-D convolutional layer, the filter tensor has shape `(fW, fH, in_channels, out_channels)`, so the fan-in is the product of the spatial dimensions (fW and fH) and the input channels (in_channels).\n2. **Calculate the limit**: The limit for the uniform distribution is given by \\(\\sqrt{6 / \\text{fan_in}}\\).\n3. **Generate the weights**: Sample each weight from a uniform distribution \\(\\mathcal{U}[-\\text{limit}, \\text{limit}]\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef he_uniform(weight_shape):\n    \"\"\"Return a NumPy ndarray initialised with He uniform distribution.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    weight_shape : tuple | list\n        Shape of the weight tensor.

For example, if the shape is `(2, 2)`, the fan-in is 2.\n   - For a convolutional layer (4D shape), the fan-in is the product of the filter's width, height, and input channels. For example, if the shape is `(3, 3, 16, 32)`, the fan-in is \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 16 = 144\\).\n2. **Limit Calculation**: The limit for the uniform distribution is derived from the fan-in using the formula \\(\\sqrt{6 / \\text{fan_in}}\\). This scaling helps maintain the variance of the activations across layers, which is crucial for training deep networks.\n3. **Weight Generation**: The weights are sampled from a uniform distribution between \\(-\\text{limit}\\) and \\(\\text{limit}\\) using NumPy's `random.uniform` function, ensuring the values are within the specified range.\n\nThis approach efficiently initializes the weights according to the He uniform initialization scheme, which is particularly effective for layers followed by ReLU activation functions."}

Thus, `n_samples` is 1, and `n_features` is the length of the array.\n   - **Multi-dimensional Array**: The first dimension represents the number of samples. The number of features is the product of the remaining dimensions. For example, an array of shape (10, 5, 3) would have 10 samples and 5 * 3 = 15 features.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef dataset_shape(X):\n    \"\"\"Inspect the input data and return *(n_samples, n_features)*.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X : array-like\n        Feature data. If *X* is one-dimensional it is treated as a single\n        sample, otherwise the first axis counts the samples.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple of two ints\n        *(n_samples, n_features)* extracted from *X* following the same logic\n        used by the `_setup_input` method in the supplied code snippet.\n    \"\"\"\n    X_array = np.asarray(X)\n    if X_array.size == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Got an empty matrix.\")\n    \n    if X_array.ndim == 1:\n        n_samples = 1\n        n_features = len(X_array)\n    else:\n        n_samples = X_array.shape[0]\n        n_features = np.prod(X_array.shape[1:])\n    \n    return (int(n_samples), int(n_features))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Conversion to NumPy Array**: The function starts by converting the input `X` into a NumPy array using `np.asarray(X)`. This handles any array-like input (lists, tuples, other array types) without modifying the original input.\n2. **Empty Check**: The function checks if the array is empty by verifying `X_array.size == 0`. If true, it raises a `ValueError` to indicate invalid input.\n3. **Dimensionality Handling**:\n   - For a one-dimensional array (`X_array.ndim == 1`), the function sets `n_samples` to 1 and `n_features` to the length of the array.\n   - For multi-dimensional arrays, `n_samples` is taken from the first dimension (`X_array.shape[0]`), and `n_features` is the product of the remaining dimensions, computed using `np.prod(X_array.shape[1:])`.\n4. **Return Tuple**: The function returns a tuple of integers `(n_samples, n_features)`, ensuring the values are converted to Python integers (though NumPy typically returns integers that can be directly used as Python integers).\n\nThis approach efficiently handles various input types and shapes, adhering to the specified logic while ensuring robustness through proper error handling."}

If it is empty, the function returns an empty list immediately.\n2. **Mean Calculation**: The arithmetic mean of the `y_train` values is computed using NumPy's `mean` function, which efficiently handles array-like inputs.\n3. **Rounding**: The computed mean is rounded to four decimal places using Python's built-in `round` function to meet the output constraints.\n4. **Prediction Generation**: A list of predictions is created where each element is the rounded mean value. The length of this list matches the number of rows in `X_test`, ensuring each test sample receives the same prediction.\n5. **Return Result**: The list of predictions is returned, fulfilling the requirement of returning a Python list of floats rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently implements a simple baseline regressor that serves as a reference point for more complex models, ensuring compatibility with the specified API and output constraints."}

For the cosine metric, it additionally checks that neither vector has a zero norm.\n3. **Metric Computation**: Depending on the metric name, `d` computes the appropriate distance. The Euclidean distance is the square root of the sum of squared differences, Manhattan is the sum of absolute differences, Chebyshev is the maximum absolute difference, and cosine distance is 1 minus the cosine similarity.\n4. **Error Handling**: If any validation fails (e.g., non-numeric values, mismatched lengths, zero norms for cosine) or the metric name is unsupported, the callable returns -1.

Otherwise, it converts the input into a NumPy array to leverage vectorized operations for efficiency.\n3. **Vectorized Computation**: The Softsign function is applied element-wise to the array using NumPy's operations, which are optimized for performance. Each element in the resulting array is then rounded to 4 decimal places and converted back to a Python list before returning.\n4. **Error Handling**: If the input type is neither a scalar nor an array-like, the function raises a TypeError to indicate invalid input.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both scalar and array inputs, ensuring correct computation and rounding while maintaining the expected output format."}

{"task_id": 197, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to write a function that analyzes the action space of a reinforcement learning environment and returns specific statistics about it. The function should handle both discrete and continuous action spaces, as well as single-dimensional and multi-dimensional cases. The solution involves checking the attributes of the environment's action space to determine the necessary statistics.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Multi-dimensional Action Space**: If the action space is multi-dimensional (`md_action` is True), the action space will have sub-spaces (accessed via `env.action_space.spaces`). For each sub-space, we need to check if it is discrete (has `n` attribute) or continuous (has `shape` attribute).\n2. **Check for Continuous Action Space**: If any dimension of the action space is continuous, the `n_actions_per_dim` list will use `np.inf` for those dimensions, and `action_ids` will be `None`.\n3. **Handle Single-dimensional Cases**: For a single-dimensional discrete space, `n_actions_per_dim` will be a list with one element (the value of `env.action_space.n`). For a single-dimensional continuous space, it will be `[np.inf]`.\n4. **Generate Action IDs for Discrete Multi-dimensional Spaces**: If all dimensions are discrete, compute the Cartesian product of all possible actions in each dimension to generate all possible action tuples.\n5. **Determine Action Dimensions**: The total number of dimensions is the length of the shape for continuous spaces, the number of sub-spaces for multi-dimensional spaces, or 1 for single-dimensional spaces.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import product\nfrom typing import Any, List, Tuple, Union\n\ndef action_stats(env: Any, md_action: bool, cont_action: bool) -> Tuple[List[Union[int, float]], Union[List[Tuple[int, ...]], None], int]:\n    \"\"\"Summarise an RL environment's action space.\n\n    Args:\n        env: Environment instance exposing an ``action_space`` attribute mimicking OpenAI Gym.\n        md_action: ``True`` if the action space is multi-dimensional.\n        cont_action: ``True`` if the action space is continuous (infinite number of actions).\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple ``(n_actions_per_dim, action_ids, action_dim)`` where\n            \u2022 n_actions_per_dim: list with the number of actions in every dimension\n                                  (``numpy.inf`` for continuous ones),\n            \u2022 action_ids: list of all discrete actions (cartesian product) or ``None`` if\n                           any dimension is continuous,\n            \u2022 action_dim: number of action dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_actions_per_dim = []\n    action_ids = None\n    action_dim = 0\n    has_continuous = False\n\n    if not md_action:\n        # Single-dimensional case\n        if cont_action:\n            # Continuous single-dimensional\n            n_actions_per_dim = [np.inf]\n            action_dim = 1\n        else:\n            # Discrete single-dimensional\n            n_actions = env.action_space.n\n            n_actions_per_dim = [n_actions]\n            action_ids = [(i,) for i in range(n_actions)]\n            action_dim = 1\n    else:\n        # Multi-dimensional case\n        subspaces = env.action_space.spaces\n        action_dim = len(subspaces)\n        for subspace in subspaces:\n            if hasattr(subspace, 'n'):\n                n_actions_per_dim.append(subspace.n)\n            elif hasattr(subspace, 'shape'):\n                n_actions_per_dim.append(np.inf)\n                has_continuous = True\n            else:\n                raise AttributeError(\"Subspace does not have 'n' or 'shape' attribute.\")\n        \n        if not has_continuous:\n            # Generate all possible action tuples\n            dim_ranges = [range(n) for n in n_actions_per_dim]\n            action_ids = list(product(*dim_ranges))\n        else:\n            action_ids = None\n    \n    return (n_actions_per_dim, action_ids, action_dim)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Single-dimensional Handling**: The function first checks if the action space is single-dimensional. If it's continuous, it sets `n_actions_per_dim` to `[np.inf]` and `action_ids` to `None`. If discrete, it lists all actions from `0` to `n-1` as tuples in a list.\n2. **Multi-dimensional Handling**: For multi-dimensional spaces, the function iterates through each sub-space. Each sub-space is checked for being discrete or continuous. Discrete sub-spaces contribute their action count to `n_actions_per_dim`, while continuous ones contribute `np.inf`. If any sub-space is continuous, `action_ids` is set to `None`; otherwise, the Cartesian product of all discrete actions is computed.\n3. **Action Dimension**: The total number of dimensions is derived from the length of the sub-spaces list for multi-dimensional spaces or set to 1 for single-dimensional spaces.\n\nThis approach efficiently categorizes the action space and provides the required statistics while handling all specified edge cases."}

The matrix \u03b2 is updated by aggregating the contributions from each document and each word in the documents, followed by normalization to ensure each column sums to one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialize the \u03b2 Matrix**: Create a matrix of zeros with dimensions V (vocabulary size) \u00d7 T (number of topics). The number of topics T can be inferred from the shape of the \u03c6 arrays.\n2. **Aggregate Contributions**: For each document in the corpus, and for each word in the document, add the corresponding \u03c6 values to the appropriate entries in the \u03b2 matrix. Specifically, for each document d, each word index v in the document, and each topic t, the \u03c6 value for that word and topic is added to \u03b2[v][t].\n3. **Normalize Columns**: After processing all documents, normalize each column of the \u03b2 matrix so that the sum of each column is 1. This involves dividing each entry in the column by the sum of the column.\n4. **Handle Zero Rows**: If a word index v (from 0 to V-1) does not appear in the corpus, its row in \u03b2 will remain zeros. The normalization step ensures that columns sum to 1, even if some rows are zero.\n5. **Rounding**: Round each entry in the \u03b2 matrix to 4 decimal places for the final output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef update_beta(phi: list[np.ndarray], corpus: list[list[int]], V: int) -> list[list[float]]:\n    \"\"\"Update the word\u2013topic distribution \u03b2 in Latent Dirichlet Allocation.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    phi : list[np.ndarray]\n        A list with one 2-D NumPy array per document.

For each word index v at position n in document d, the corresponding \u03c6 values (\u03c6[d][n][t] for each topic t) are added to \u03b2[v][t]. This step effectively counts the weighted contributions of each word to each topic across all documents.\n3. **Normalization**: Each column of \u03b2 is normalized by dividing each entry by the column sum. This ensures that each column (topic) sums to 1, making it a valid probability distribution. If a column sum is zero (which can happen if no words are assigned to a topic), the column is left as zeros to avoid division by zero.\n4. **Rounding and Conversion**: The normalized \u03b2 matrix is rounded to 4 decimal places and converted from a NumPy array to a nested list (list of lists) to meet the output requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the updated \u03b2 matrix while handling edge cases such as missing vocabulary indices and ensuring proper normalization."}

The mask will be `True` for elements in `X` that are strictly less than the threshold, and `False` otherwise.\n2. **Splitting Labels**: Use the boolean mask to split the label vector `y` into two parts:\n   - `y_left` will contain all elements of `y` where the corresponding element in `X` is strictly less than the threshold.\n   - `y_right` will contain all elements of `y` where the corresponding element in `X` is greater than or equal to the threshold.\n3. **Conversion to Lists**: Convert the resulting NumPy arrays for `y_left` and `y_right` into Python lists before returning them.

Using NumPy's array functionality, we can flatten the input into a 1-dimensional array, which simplifies summing all absolute values.\n2. **Sum Absolute Values**: Calculate the sum of the absolute values of all elements in the flattened array.\n3. **Multiply by C**: Multiply this sum by the regularization strength C to get the L1 penalty.\n4. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the weights are empty (i.e., no elements), the sum should be zero, leading to a penalty of zero regardless of C.\n5. **Round the Result**: Round the resulting penalty to four decimal places before returning it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_l1_penalty(weights, C):\n    \"\"\"Compute the L1 regularization penalty.\n\n    Args:\n        weights: Sequence or np.ndarray containing numeric weights (any shape).\n        C: Regularization strength (non-negative float).\n\n    Returns:\n        L1 penalty (float) rounded to 4 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    if C < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Regularization strength C must be non-negative.\")\n    \n    if not weights:\n        return 0.0\n    \n    weights_array = np.array(weights, dtype=np.float64)\n    l1_sum = np.sum(np.abs(weights_array))\n    penalty = C * l1_sum\n    \n    return round(penalty, 4)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Flattening the Weights**: The input `weights` is converted into a NumPy array, which allows handling nested lists or arrays uniformly. NumPy's array operations efficiently flatten the structure for processing.\n2. **Summing Absolute Values**: The absolute value of each element is taken using `np.abs`, and then summed up with `np.sum`. This handles all elements regardless of the original shape of the input.\n3. **Regularization Strength**: The sum of absolute values is multiplied by the regularization parameter `C` to compute the penalty. If `C` is zero, the penalty will be zero, which is valid.\n4. **Edge Handling**: If the input `weights` is empty (checked by `if not weights`), the function immediately returns 0.0, as there are no elements to sum.\n5. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to four decimal places using Python's built-in `round` function to meet the specified output constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles various input types and edge cases while providing the correct L1 penalty computation."}
{"task_id": 201, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that clips the Euclidean (L2) norm of slices of a NumPy array along a specified axis to a maximum value `m`. The solution involves calculating the norms of these slices, scaling them down if they exceed the threshold `m`, and ensuring numerical stability with a small epsilon value to avoid division by zero.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Handle the Axis Parameter**: If the axis is `None`, treat the entire array as a single vector. Otherwise, proceed to process each slice along the specified axis.\n2. **Compute Norms**: For each slice along the chosen axis, compute its L2 norm. Add a small epsilon (1e-12) to the norm to prevent division by zero.\n3. **Scaling Factor**: For each slice, determine the scaling factor as the minimum of 1 and `m / (norm + epsilon)`. This ensures that if the norm is already less than or equal to `m`, the scaling factor is 1, leaving the slice unchanged.\n4. **Apply Scaling**: Multiply each slice by its corresponding scaling factor to ensure its norm does not exceed `m`.\n5. **Rounding and Conversion**: Round the resulting array to four decimal places and convert it to a nested Python list before returning.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef max_norm(p, m=2.0, axis=0):\n    \"\"\"Clip the L2 norm of slices of *p* along *axis* so that they do not exceed *m*.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    p : np.ndarray\n        Input tensor (weights) of arbitrary shape.\n    m : float, optional\n        Maximum allowed L2 norm for each slice.

If so, it treats the entire array as a single vector, computes its norm, and scales it if necessary.\n2. **Norm Calculation**: For a specified axis, the function computes the L2 norm of each slice along that axis. The `keepdims=True` parameter ensures that the norms can be broadcasted back to the original array shape for element-wise multiplication.\n3. **Scaling Factor**: The scaling factor for each slice is computed as the minimum of 1 and `m / (norm + epsilon)`, ensuring numerical stability. This factor scales down the slice if its norm exceeds `m`.\n4. **Application of Scaling**: Each slice is multiplied by its corresponding scaling factor, effectively clipping its norm to at most `m`.\n5. **Rounding and Conversion**: The resulting array is rounded to four decimal places and converted to a nested Python list to meet the output requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the norm clipping while ensuring numerical stability and correct output formatting."}

{"task_id": 204, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to write a Python function that counts the number of missing elements in a one-dimensional iterable. The missing elements are defined as `None` or `NaN` (Not-a-Number) values. The solution should not use the `pandas` library and should rely only on the Python standard library and NumPy.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert the Input to a List**: Since the input can be any iterable (like a NumPy array, list, tuple, etc.), we first convert it into a list to handle it uniformly.\n2. **Check for Missing Values**: For each element in the list, we need to check if it is either `None` or `NaN`. \n   - For `None`, the check is straightforward using the `is` operator.\n   - For `NaN`, we need to handle NumPy's `NaN` values and Python's `math.nan`. However, checking for `NaN` requires special handling because `NaN` values are not equal to themselves. Therefore, we use `math.isnan()` or `np.isnan()` functions, but we must first ensure the element is of a type that can be a `NaN` (i.e., a float or a NumPy float type).\n3. **Count Missing Values**: Iterate through each element in the list, apply the checks mentioned above, and count how many elements meet the criteria for being missing.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef num_missing(data) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count missing values in a 1-D iterable.\n\n    An element is missing if it is ``None`` or ``NaN``.\n\n    Args:\n        data: Any 1-D iterable (list, tuple, NumPy array, etc.).\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of missing elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for element in data:\n        if element is None:\n            count += 1\n        elif isinstance(element, (float, np.floating)):\n            if math.isnan(element):\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Conversion Handling**: The function processes each element directly from the iterable without explicitly converting it to a list, which works because iteration is supported by all standard iterables.\n2. **Checking for `None`**: The condition `element is None` checks if the element is exactly `None`.\n3. **Checking for `NaN`**: The condition `isinstance(element, (float, np.floating))` ensures the element is a float type (either Python's float or NumPy's floating types). Then, `math.isnan(element)` checks if the element is a `NaN`. This works because `math.isnan()` correctly identifies `NaN` values, which are not equal to themselves.\n4. **Counting Missing Values**: The function increments the count each time it encounters a `None` or a `NaN` value, then returns the total count.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each element in the iterable for missing values while handling both Python and NumPy types correctly, providing an accurate count of missing elements."}

Otherwise, return -1 indicating an invalid configuration.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef convolution_shape(img_height: int,\n                      img_width: int,\n                      filter_shape: tuple[int, int],\n                      stride: tuple[int, int],\n                      padding: tuple[int, int]) -> tuple[int, int] | int:\n    \"\"\"Compute the spatial dimensions of the output produced by a 2-D convolution.\n\n    Args:\n        img_height (int): Height of the input image.\n        img_width (int):  Width of the input image.\n        filter_shape (tuple[int, int]): (kernel_height, kernel_width).\n        stride (tuple[int, int]):       (stride_height, stride_width).\n        padding (tuple[int, int]):      (pad_height, pad_width).\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple[int, int] | int: (output_height, output_width) if the parameters\n            yield a valid integer output size; otherwise -1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Unpack the tuples\n    kh, kw = filter_shape\n    sh, sw = stride\n    ph, pw = padding\n    \n    # Check for invalid parameters: non-positive strides, kernel dimensions, or image dimensions\n    if sh <= 0 or sw <= 0 or kh <= 0 or kw <= 0 or img_height <= 0 or img_width <= 0:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Calculate the numerator parts for height and width\n    numerator_h = img_height + 2 * ph - kh\n    numerator_w = img_width + 2 * pw - kw\n    \n    # Check if numerators are non-negative\n    if numerator_h < 0 or numerator_w < 0:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Compute OH and OW\n    try:\n        oh = (numerator_h) / sh + 1\n        ow = (numerator_w) / sw + 1\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Check if oh and ow are positive integers\n    if (oh.is_integer() and ow.is_integer()) and (oh > 0 and ow > 0):\n        return (int(oh), int(ow))\n    else:\n        return -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Parameter Validation**: The function first checks if any of the parameters (strides, kernel dimensions, or image dimensions) are non-positive. If so, it returns -1 immediately because these values must be positive for a valid convolution.\n2. **Numerator Calculation**: The numerators for both output height and width are computed. These values must be non-negative; otherwise, the kernel would be larger than the padded image, making convolution impossible.\n3. **Output Dimension Calculation**: The output dimensions are computed using the given formulas. The function checks if the results are positive integers. If they are, it returns them as a tuple; otherwise, it returns -1 indicating an invalid configuration.\n4. **Edge Cases Handling**: The solution handles edge cases such as zero strides (though strides are checked to be positive initially) and ensures that all intermediate calculations are valid before proceeding to the final checks.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function accurately determines the output dimensions only when the configuration is valid, adhering to the constraints and requirements specified in the problem."}

The solution involves handling two scenarios: when the categories are provided and when they are inferred from the labels. Additionally, we need to check for any labels not present in the provided categories and return -1 in such cases.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Handle Categories**: \n   - If the `categories` argument is provided, use it as the complete set of possible categories. The order of categories in the list will determine the columns of the one-hot encoded matrix.\n   - If `categories` is not provided, deduce the categories from the `labels` list, preserving the order of their first appearance.\n2. **Check for Unknown Labels**: If `categories` is provided and any label in `labels` is not found in `categories`, return -1.\n3. **One-Hot Encoding**: For each label in `labels`, create a binary vector where the position corresponding to the category's index is 1, and all other positions are 0. This can be efficiently done using NumPy's array operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef one_hot_encode(labels: list[str], categories: list[str] | None = None) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"Convert categorical labels to a one-hot encoded matrix.\n\n    Args:\n        labels: A list of categorical labels of length *N*.\n        categories: Optional complete list of unique categories of length *C*.\n            If *None*, the set of categories is inferred from *labels* in the\n            order of their first appearance.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists that represents the one-hot encoded matrix of shape\n        (N, C) where *C* is the number of categories.

This ensures the order is preserved as required.\n   - If `categories` is provided, the code checks each label in `labels` to ensure it exists in `categories`. If any label is not found, the function immediately returns -1.\n2. **Mapping Categories to Indices**: A dictionary maps each category to its respective index in the `categories` list. This helps in quickly locating the position of each label in the one-hot matrix.\n3. **Constructing One-Hot Matrix**: Using NumPy, a matrix of zeros is created with dimensions (N, C), where N is the number of labels and C is the number of categories. For each label, the corresponding index in the matrix is set to 1, creating the one-hot encoded vector.\n4. **Conversion to List**: The NumPy array is converted to a list of lists using the `tolist()` method before returning the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both scenarios (provided or inferred categories) and checks for invalid labels, ensuring correctness and adherence to the specified requirements."}

{"task_id": 210, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to create a decorator called `doublewrap` that allows a decorator factory to be used both with and without parentheses. This means the decorated decorator should work when called directly (e.g., `@decorator`) or with arguments (e.g., `@decorator(arg=value)`).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The core issue is that a regular decorator without arguments can be applied directly to a function, but a decorator with arguments requires an additional layer of nesting. The `doublewrap` function should handle both cases seamlessly.\n2. **Handling Both Cases**: The `doublewrap` function will return a new decorator. This new decorator will check how it is being called:\n   - **Without Parentheses**: If the decorator is called with a single positional argument that is a callable (the function to be decorated), it will directly apply the original decorator function to this callable.\n   - **With Parentheses**: If the decorator is called with arguments (positional or keyword), it will return another decorator that waits for the function to be decorated. Once the function is provided, it will apply the original decorator function with both the function and the provided arguments.\n3. **Preserving Metadata**: Using `functools.wraps`, the metadata (like `__name__`, `__doc__`, etc.) of the original decorator function should be preserved in the returned decorator to maintain proper documentation and debugging information.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport functools\nfrom typing import Callable, Any\n\n\ndef doublewrap(decorator_func: Callable[..., Callable[..., Any]]) -> Callable[..., Any]:\n    \"\"\"Return a decorator that can be used *with* or *without* parentheses.\n\n    Args:\n        decorator_func: A callable that expects the function to decorate as\n            its first positional argument followed only by *optional*\n            positional or keyword arguments.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new decorator that forwards the call in the correct form so that\n        ``decorator_func`` can be applied either directly or after receiving\n        its own optional parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    @functools.wraps(decorator_func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        if len(args) == 1 and len(kwargs) == 0 and callable(args[0]):\n            # Case when decorator is used without parentheses, e.g., @decorator\n            return decorator_func(args[0])\n        else:\n            # Case when decorator is used with parentheses, e.g., @decorator(arg=value)\n            def real_decorator(func):\n                return decorator_func(func, *args, **kwargs)\n            return real_decorator\n    return wrapper\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Wrapper Function**: The `wrapper` function is the core of the solution. It checks how it is being called:\n   - **Direct Application (No Parentheses)**: If `wrapper` is called with a single positional argument that is a callable (the function to decorate), it directly applies `decorator_func` to this function.\n   - **With Arguments (Parentheses)**: If `wrapper` is called with arguments (positional or keyword), it returns a new function `real_decorator` that will later receive the function to decorate. When `real_decorator` gets the function, it applies `decorator_func` with the function and the stored arguments.\n2. **Metadata Preservation**: The `functools.wraps` decorator ensures that the `wrapper` function retains the metadata (like `__name__`, `__doc__`, etc.) of the original `decorator_func`, making the decorated function appear as if it was wrapped directly by `decorator_func`.\n\nThis approach elegantly handles both use cases, allowing the decorator to be used flexibly with or without arguments while maintaining the expected behavior and preserving metadata."}

If either condition is met, return -1 immediately.\n2. **Calculate Mismatches**: For each corresponding pair of labels in the `actual` and `predicted` sequences, count how many times they differ.\n3. **Compute Classification Error**: The classification error is the ratio of the number of mismatches to the total number of samples.\n4. **Compute Accuracy**: Subtract the classification error from 1 to get the accuracy.\n5. **Rounding**: Round the resulting accuracy to four decimal places before returning it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef accuracy(actual, predicted):\n    \"\"\"Return the classification accuracy between two sequences of labels.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    actual : Sequence\n        The ground-truth labels.\n    predicted : Sequence\n        The predicted labels.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    float\n        Accuracy rounded to four decimal places, or -1 if the inputs\n        are empty or of unequal length.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(actual) != len(predicted) or len(actual) == 0:\n        return -1\n    \n    mismatches = sum(1 for a, p in zip(actual, predicted) if a != p)\n    total_samples = len(actual)\n    classification_error = mismatches / total_samples\n    accuracy_value = 1.0 - classification_error\n    return round(accuracy_value, 4)\n```\n\nWait, there's a syntax error in the generator expression inside the sum function. The correct line should be:\n\n```python\n    mismatches = sum(1 for a, p in zip(actual, predicted) if a != p)\n```\n\nWait, no. The correct syntax for the generator expression is:\n\n```python\n    mismatches = sum(1 for a, p in zip(actual, predicted) if a != p)\n```\n\nBut in Python, the condition comes before the loop in a generator expression.

{"task_id": 212, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the \"input\" layer to the \"output_realtime\" layer in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) represented by an adjacency list. If there are multiple shortest paths, we should return the lexicographically smallest one. If no path exists, we return an empty list.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. We will use BFS to explore the graph starting from the \"input\" layer, level by level, until we reach the \"output_realtime\" layer.\n2. **Tracking Paths**: During BFS, we will keep track of the path taken to reach each node. This allows us to reconstruct the path once the target node is found.\n3. **Handling Multiple Shortest Paths**: If multiple shortest paths exist, we need to select the lexicographically smallest one. To handle this, during BFS, whenever we encounter the target node, we will note the path and continue processing other nodes at the same level to ensure we find all possible shortest paths. After BFS completes, we compare all found shortest paths and select the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef extract_realtime_model(graph: dict[str, list[str]]) -> list[str]:\n    \"\"\"Find a shortest path from 'input' to 'output_realtime'.\"\"\"\n    if \"input\" not in graph:\n        return []\n    \n    queue = deque()\n    queue.append( (\"input\", [\"input\"]) )\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(\"input\")\n    shortest_paths = []\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_layer, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_layer == \"output_realtime\":\n            shortest_paths.append(path)\n            continue  # continue to process other paths at the same level\n        \n        for neighbor in sorted(graph.get(current_layer, [])):\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                new_path = path + [neighbor]\n                queue.append( (neighbor, new_path) )\n            # Note: We don't process nodes already visited to avoid cycles and ensure shortest path\n    \n    if not shortest_paths:\n        return []\n    \n    # Find the lexicographically smallest path among all shortest paths\n    shortest_paths.sort()\n    return shortest_paths[0]\n```\n\nWait, but this approach might not work correctly if there are multiple paths to the same node at the same level. For example, if during BFS, we reach a node via two different paths of the same length, the first path processed would mark the node as visited, preventing the second path from being considered. However, in BFS for shortest paths, the first time a node is encountered is via the shortest path. Subsequent visits would not yield shorter paths. But if there are multiple shortest paths, we need to capture all of them.\n\nBut in the current code, once a node is visited, any other paths to it are ignored. This means that if there are multiple shortest paths to \"output_realtime\", the code might not capture all of them. For example, consider the following graph:\n\ngraph = {\n    \"input\": [\"A\", \"B\"],\n    \"A\": [\"output_realtime\"],\n    \"B\": [\"output_realtime\"]\n}\n\nThe BFS would process \"input\", then add \"A\" and \"B\" to the queue (assuming they are processed in sorted order). When processing \"A\", it finds \"output_realtime\" and adds the path [\"input\", \"A\", \"output_realtime\"] to shortest_paths. Then, when processing \"B\", it also finds \"output_realtime\" and adds [\"input\", \"B\", \"output_realtime\"]. After processing, the shortest_paths would contain both paths, and the lex smallest is [\"input\", \"A\", \"output_realtime\"].\n\nSo the current approach works for this case. But what if the graph has a diamond shape with multiple paths to a node before reaching the target? For example:\n\ngraph = {\n    \"input\": [\"A\", \"B\"],\n    \"A\": [\"C\"],\n    \"B\": [\"C\"],\n    \"C\": [\"output_realtime\"]\n}\n\nHere, the shortest path is of length 3 (input -> A or B -> C -> output_realtime). The BFS would process \"input\", then \"A\" and \"B\" (sorted), then their neighbors. When processing \"A\", it adds \"C\" to the queue with path [\"input\", \"A\", \"C\"]. Similarly, processing \"B\" adds [\"input\", \"B\", \"C\"]. Then, when processing \"C\" (from either path), it finds \"output_realtime\" and adds the path [\"input\", \"A\", \"C\", \"output_realtime\"] and [\"input\", \"B\", \"C\", \"output_realtime\"]. The lex smallest would be the first one.\n\nSo the current approach seems to handle these cases. However, the initial code may not handle cases where nodes can be revisited in a way that leads to the target via different paths of the same length. For example, if the graph has a cycle that doesn't affect the shortest path, but the current code marks nodes as visited once, potentially missing some paths.\n\nBut the problem states that the graph is a DAG (directed acyclic graph), so there are no cycles. Therefore, the current approach should work correctly.\n\nBut wait, the problem description says \"In many neural-network libraries a model can be viewed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\", but the note later says \"The input graph is guaranteed to have no self-loops, but it can contain cycles or multiple outgoing branches\". So the graph can have cycles. This means that the initial approach of marking nodes as visited once may not capture all shortest paths.\n\nFor example, consider the graph:\n\ngraph = {\n    \"input\": [\"A\"],\n    \"A\": [\"B\"],\n    \"B\": [\"A\", \"output_realtime\"],\n}\n\nHere, the shortest path is input -> A -> B -> output_realtime. The BFS would process \"input\", then \"A\", then \"B\" (path [\"input\", \"A\", \"B\"]), then when processing \"B\", it would find \"output_realtime\" and add the path [\"input\", \"A\", \"B\", \"output_realtime\"]. But if \"B\" also points back to \"A\", the cycle doesn't affect the shortest path. However, if there was another path from \"A\" to \"output_realtime\", the current code would miss it once \"A\" is marked as visited.\n\nBut in this case, the shortest path is still captured. So perhaps the code works even with cycles, as long as the first time we reach a node is via the shortest path.\n\nBut to ensure that all possible shortest paths are considered, we should allow revisiting nodes if the current path length is the same as the previously recorded shortest path length to that node. This requires modifying the visited tracking to keep track of the shortest distance to each node and allowing revisits if the current path's length is equal to the recorded distance.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to use a BFS where for each node, we track the shortest distance from the input. If we encounter a node again with the same distance as previously recorded, we process it again to capture all possible shortest paths.\n\nHere's the modified approach:\n\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (\"input\") and its path ([\"input\"]).\n2. Use a dictionary to keep track of the shortest distance to each node. The distance to \"input\" is 0.\n3. For each node processed, explore its neighbors. For each neighbor:\n   - If it hasn't been visited yet, record its distance and add it to the queue with the new path.\n   - If it has been visited but the current path's length is equal to the recorded distance, add it to the queue to explore other paths.\n4. When the target node (\"output_realtime\") is found, record all paths that reach it with the same (shortest) distance.\n5. After BFS completes, if any paths were found, return the lexicographically smallest one.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef extract_realtime_model(graph: dict[str, list[str]]) -> list[str]:\n    \"\"\"Find a shortest path from 'input' to 'output_realtime'.\"\"\"\n    if \"input\" not in graph:\n        return []\n    \n    queue = deque()\n    queue.append( [\"input\"] )\n    shortest_distance = {\"input\": 0}\n    found_paths = []\n    \n    while queue:\n        path = queue.popleft()\n        current_layer = path[-1]\n        \n        if current_layer == \"output_realtime\":\n            found_paths.append(path)\n            continue\n        \n        for neighbor in sorted(graph.get(current_layer, [])):\n            if neighbor not in shortest_distance:\n                shortest_distance[neighbor] = shortest_distance[current_layer] + 1\n                new_path = path + [neighbor]\n                queue.append(new_path)\n            elif shortest_distance[neighbor] == shortest_distance[current_layer] + 1:\n                new_path = path + [neighbor]\n                queue.append(new_path)\n    \n    if not found_paths:\n        return []\n    \n    found_paths.sort()\n    return found_paths[0]\n```\n\nThis code ensures that all shortest paths are considered by allowing nodes to be processed multiple times if they are reached via paths of the same (shortest) length. This is crucial for graphs with cycles or multiple paths to the same node. The paths are collected and the lexicographically smallest one is returned.\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The BFS starts from the \"input\" layer with an initial path [\"input\"].\n2. **Queue Processing**: The queue processes each path in FIFO order, exploring each layer's neighbors.\n3. **Distance Tracking**: The `shortest_distance` dictionary keeps track of the minimal steps required to reach each layer from \"input\". If a neighbor is encountered for the first time, its distance is recorded. If it's encountered again via a path of the same length, the new path is added to the queue.\n4. **Path Collection**: When \"output_realtime\" is found, the current path is added to `found_paths`.\n5. **Result Selection**: After BFS completes, if paths were found, the lexicographically smallest path is selected and returned. If no path exists, an empty list is returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles graphs with cycles and multiple paths, ensuring the shortest and lexicographically smallest path is found."}
{"task_id": 213, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the He Normal weight initializer, which initializes weights based on the shape of the tensor.

If so, it returns an empty list.\n2. **fan_in and fan_out Calculation**: Based on the length of the shape tuple, the function calculates fan_in and fan_out. For 1D tensors, both are set to the single dimension. For 2D tensors, they correspond to the input and output units. For higher dimensions, they are computed by considering the product of the remaining dimensions (receptive field size) multiplied by in_channels (fan_in) or out_channels (fan_out).\n3. **Weight Generation**: Using NumPy's random number generator with a fixed seed (42), the function generates normally distributed values with mean 0 and standard deviation \u221a(2 / fan_in). This ensures reproducibility of results.\n4. **Conversion to List**: The generated NumPy array is converted to a nested Python list using the `tolist()` method before returning.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles different tensor shapes and ensures the weights are initialized according to the He Normal strategy, providing consistent results due to the fixed random seed."}

This conversion allows the use of NumPy's vectorized operations, which are efficient and concise.\n3. **MSE Calculation**: The squared differences between corresponding elements of the actual and predicted arrays are computed. The mean of these squared differences gives the MSE.\n4. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to four decimal places using NumPy's `round` function to meet the specified precision requirement.

Equal scores result in a draw.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef blackjack_outcome(player: list[int], dealer: list[int]) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Evaluate the outcome of a finished round of Blackjack.\"\"\"\n\n    def calculate_hand_value(hand: list[int]) -> int:\n        total = sum(hand)\n        aces = hand.count(1)\n        # Check if we can use an Ace as 11\n        if aces > 0 and total + 10 <= 21:\n            total += 10\n        return total\n\n    player_value = calculate_hand_value(player)\n    dealer_value = calculate_hand_value(dealer)\n\n    # Check if player busts\n    if player_value > 21:\n        return -1.0\n    \n    # Check if dealer busts (player didn't)\n    if dealer_value > 21:\n        return 1.0\n    \n    # Check for player's natural blackjack\n    player_natural = len(player) == 2 and player_value == 21 and (1 in player) and (10 in player)\n    dealer_natural = len(dealer) == 2 and dealer_value == 21 and (1 in dealer) and (10 in dealer)\n    \n    if player_natural:\n        if not dealer_natural:\n            return 1.5\n        else:\n            return 0.0\n    \n    # Regular comparison\n    if player_value > dealer_value:\n        return 1.0\n    elif player_value < dealer_value:\n        return -1.0\n    else:\n        return 0.0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Hand Value Calculation**: The `calculate_hand_value` function computes the optimal value of a hand by summing the card values. If there's an Ace and converting it to 11 keeps the total \u2264 21, it adjusts the total accordingly.\n2. **Bust Check**: The player loses immediately if their hand value exceeds 21. If the dealer busts and the player hasn't, the player wins.\n3. **Natural Blackjack Check**: The player wins with a reward of 1.5 if they have a natural blackjack (exactly two cards: Ace and 10) and the dealer does not. If both have natural blackjacks, it's a draw (0).\n4. **Score Comparison**: If no special conditions apply, the player's and dealer's hand values are compared. The player wins if their score is higher, loses if it's lower, and draws if scores are equal.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all the specified Blackjack rules to determine the correct reward for the player."}

If they are, the corresponding result (phi or theta) is set to an empty list.\n2. **Computing \u03d5**:\n   - For the word-topic matrix `C_wt`, the code calculates the denominator for each topic by summing the counts of all words for that topic and adding \\(V \\cdot \\beta\\).\n   - The smoothed probabilities are then computed by adding \\(\\beta\\) to each count and dividing by the respective topic's denominator.

The result is similarly rounded and converted to a nested list.\n4. **Return Results**: The function returns the computed phi and theta matrices as nested lists, ensuring all values are rounded to four decimal places.

{"task_id": 222, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the sigmoid activation function that works element-wise for various input types (scalar, list, or NumPy array) while ensuring numerical stability for very large positive or negative values. The solution should handle different input types appropriately and return results rounded to four decimal places.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Numerical Stability**: The sigmoid function can be computed in a numerically stable way by splitting the computation based on the sign of the input values. For positive values (z \u2265 0), we compute 1 / (1 + exp(-z)), which avoids large negative exponents. For negative values (z < 0), we compute exp(z) / (1 + exp(z)) to prevent overflow from large positive exponents.\n2. **Element-wise Handling**: The function should process each element in the input array or list individually. Using NumPy's vectorized operations will efficiently handle this for arrays.\n3. **Input Handling**: The function should check the input type. If it's a scalar (int or float), process it directly. If it's a list or NumPy array, convert it to a NumPy array to leverage vectorized operations, then process each element.\n4. **Rounding and Output Type**: The results should be rounded to four decimal places.

If so, it computes the sigmoid using the standard formula. For negative numbers, it uses an alternative formula to avoid numerical overflow. The result is rounded to four decimal places and returned as a float.\n2. **Array Handling**: For list or NumPy array inputs, the function converts the input into a NumPy array to utilize vectorized operations. The `np.where` function is used to apply the appropriate sigmoid computation based on the sign of each element. This ensures numerical stability. The results are then rounded to four decimal places and converted back to a Python list to meet the output requirements.\n3. **Numerical Stability**: By splitting the computation based on the sign of the input values, the function avoids potential overflow or underflow issues that can occur with very large positive or negative numbers, ensuring accurate results across the entire input range."}
{"task_id": 224, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to write a Python function that applies the Leaky ReLU activation function to every element in an input tensor, which can be a scalar, a nested list, or a NumPy array. The function should handle these different input types uniformly and return the result as a Python list with the same structure as the input.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Input Type**: The input `z` can be a scalar, a list (possibly nested), or a NumPy array. We need to handle each case appropriately.\n2. **Recursive Processing for Nested Lists**: If the input is a list (including nested lists), we will process each element recursively. For each element in the list, if it is itself a list, we continue recursion; otherwise, we apply the Leaky ReLU function.\n3. **NumPy Array Handling**: If the input is a NumPy array, we can leverage NumPy's vectorized operations to apply the Leaky ReLU function efficiently. The result will then be converted back to a Python list.\n4. **Scalar Handling**: If the input is a scalar (a single number), we directly apply the Leaky ReLU function and return it as a single-element list (though the problem might expect the scalar to be returned as is, but the note says return as a list with the same structure. For a scalar, returning it as a scalar might be more intuitive, but the problem specifies returning a list. However, the note says same structure, so a scalar should return a scalar. Clarifying the problem statement is important here. The description says \"return the activated values with the same shape as z, converted to a plain Python list with numpy.ndarray.tolist() when necessary.\" For a scalar, the same shape would be a scalar, but the function's return type is a list. However, the example might expect a scalar to be returned as a scalar inside a list. But the problem says \"same structure\", so if the input is a scalar, the output should be a scalar (not wrapped in a list). However, the function's docstring says it returns a Python list. This is ambiguous. The solution will assume that if the input is a scalar, the output is the activated scalar (not wrapped in a list). For lists or arrays, the output is a list (or nested lists) of the same structure.\n5. **Leaky ReLU Application**: For each numerical value, if the value is greater than or equal to zero, it remains unchanged. If the value is negative, it is multiplied by the slope parameter `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef leaky_relu(z, a=0.01):\n    \"\"\"Apply the Leaky ReLU activation to every element in *z*.\n\n    Args:\n        z: A scalar, list (possibly nested) or ``numpy.ndarray`` of numbers.\n        a: Optional float in [0,1) \u2014 the slope for negative inputs. Defaults to 0.01.\n\n    Returns:\n        A Python list with the same structure as *z* where each value has been transformed\n        by the Leaky ReLU activation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(z, (list, np.ndarray)):\n        if isinstance(z, np.ndarray):\n            activated = np.where(z >= 0, z, a * z)\n            return activated.tolist()\n        else:\n            # Handle nested lists recursively\n            return [leaky_relu(element, a) for element in z]\n    else:\n        # Handle scalar case\n        return z if z >= 0 else a * z\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The function first checks if the input `z` is a list or a NumPy array. \n   - **NumPy Array**: If `z` is a NumPy array, it uses NumPy's `where` function to apply the Leaky ReLU element-wise. The result is converted to a Python list using `tolist()`.\n   - **List**: If `z` is a list (including nested lists), the function processes each element recursively. Each element is passed through `leaky_relu` again, ensuring nested structures are handled correctly.\n   - **Scalar**: If `z` is a scalar (neither list nor array), the function checks if it is non-negative. If so, it returns the scalar unchanged; otherwise, it returns the scalar multiplied by `a`.\n2. **Recursive Processing**: For nested lists, each element is processed in turn. If an element is a list, the function calls itself recursively, ensuring all levels of nesting are processed correctly.\n3. **Efficiency**: The use of NumPy's vectorized operations for arrays ensures efficient computation without explicit loops, while recursion handles nested lists gracefully.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function works for scalars, lists, and NumPy arrays of any shape, returning the result in the same structure as the input, converted to a Python list where necessary."}

If not, it raises an AssertionError to ensure only valid formulas are used.\n2. **Array Conversion**: The input `hz` is converted into a NumPy array to handle both single values and multi-dimensional arrays uniformly. This allows vectorized operations which are efficient and concise.\n3. **Formula Application**: Depending on the chosen formula, the function applies the corresponding logarithmic transformation:\n   - For \"htk\", it uses base-10 logarithm (`log10`).\n   - For \"slaney\", it uses natural logarithm (`log`).\n4. **Rounding and Conversion**: The resulting mel values are rounded to four decimal places using NumPy's `round` function.

A lower error results in a higher alpha, giving more influence to more accurate stumps.\n4. **Updating Weights**: Misclassified samples have their weights increased, making them more critical in subsequent iterations. The weights are normalized to maintain a distribution.\n5. **Prediction**: For each test sample, the algorithm aggregates the weighted predictions of all stumps. The final prediction is the sign of this weighted sum, converting it to -1 or 1.\n\nThis approach efficiently combines multiple weak learners to form a strong classifier, leveraging the iterative focus on misclassified samples to improve overall accuracy."}

{"task_id": 232, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to verify whether a given NumPy array meets the criteria of a valid one-hot matrix. The criteria are that the matrix must be two-dimensional, all elements must be either 0 or 1, and each row must contain exactly one 1. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check if the array is two-dimensional**: The array's `ndim` attribute should be 2.\n2. **Check if all elements are binary (0 or 1)**: We can use NumPy's `unique` function to find all distinct elements in the array and verify that they are only 0 and 1.\n3. **Check each row has exactly one 1**: For each row in the array, the sum of the elements should be exactly 1. This can be checked by summing each row (axis=1) and verifying that all sums are 1.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_one_hot(x: np.ndarray) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if *x* is a valid one-hot encoded NumPy array.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : np.ndarray\n        A NumPy array to verify.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    bool\n        True if *x* is one-hot encoded, otherwise False.\n    \"\"\"\n    if x.ndim != 2:\n        return False\n    \n    unique_values = np.unique(x)\n    if not np.array_equal(unique_values, [0, 1]) and not np.array_equal(unique_values, [0]) and not np.array_equal(unique_values, [1]):\n        # Check if the only values are 0 and 1, but sometimes arrays might have only 0 or 1 (though rows must have one 1)\n        # However, if there are other values, return False\n        if not (set(unique_values.tolist()).issubset({0, 1})):\n            return False\n    \n    row_sums = np.sum(x, axis=1)\n    if not np.all(row_sums == 1):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n```\n\nWait, but the third condition is that each row must contain exactly one 1. So even if the unique values are only 0 and 1, but some rows sum to something other than 1, it's invalid. So the code checks:\n\n1. The array is 2D.\n2. All elements are 0 or 1.\n3. Each row sums to 1.\n\nBut there's a potential edge case where the array has only one row with a single 1 and the rest 0s, which would pass. But if the array has rows that sum to 0 or more than 1, it fails.\n\nBut the code above checks for unique values being a subset of {0, 1}, and then checks row sums. \n\nHowever, the initial check for unique values might be redundant because if all row sums are 1, then there must be at least one 1 in each row, and no other values. But if there are other values like 2, the sum could still be 1 (e.g., a row [2, -1, 0] sums to 1), but the elements are not binary. So the unique values check is necessary.\n\nBut the current code checks if the unique values are exactly [0, 1], or [0], or [1]. But if the array has only 1s, then each row must sum to 1, which would only be possible if each row has exactly one element (since each element is 1). For example, a 3x1 array of [[1], [1], [1]] would pass the row sums check (each row sums to 1), and unique values are [1], which is allowed. But is this considered a valid one-hot matrix? Yes, because each row has exactly one 1. So the code handles this case correctly.\n\nBut if the array has unique values like [0, 1, 2], then the first condition in the unique check would fail, and the function returns False.\n\nSo the code should work for all cases.\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dimensionality Check**: The function first checks if the input array is two-dimensional. If not, it immediately returns False.\n2. **Binary Values Check**: The function then checks if all elements in the array are either 0 or 1. This is done by examining the unique values in the array. If any value other than 0 or 1 is found, the function returns False.\n3. **Row Sum Check**: Finally, the function checks if each row sums to exactly 1. This ensures that each row contains exactly one 1, which is the defining characteristic of a one-hot encoded matrix. If any row does not meet this criterion, the function returns False.\n\nIf all checks pass, the function returns True, indicating that the input array is a valid one-hot matrix.

{"task_id": 235, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a 1-dimensional NumPy array of integer class labels into a one-hot encoded 2-D NumPy array. The solution involves several steps, including validating the input, determining the number of classes, and creating the one-hot encoded matrix efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Validation**: \n   - Check if the input array `labels` is 1-dimensional. If not, raise a `ValueError`.\n   - If `n_classes` is provided, ensure it is at least `max(labels) + 1` to accommodate all class labels. Otherwise, raise a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Determine Number of Classes**:\n   - If `n_classes` is `None`, set the number of classes to `max(labels) + 1`.\n   - If `n_classes` is provided, use it directly after validation.\n\n3. **One-Hot Encoding**:\n   - Initialize a zero matrix of shape (N, C), where N is the number of labels and C is the number of classes.\n   - Use advanced indexing to place 1.0 in the appropriate positions.

{"task_id": 236, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to create a utility function that splits a dataset into mini-batches of indices. The function should handle shuffling the indices if required and then yield consecutive slices of these indices in batches of the specified size. The last batch may be smaller if the total number of samples is not a multiple of the batch size. The function should return a generator that yields these batches and the total number of batches.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Generate Indices**: Create an array of indices from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of samples in the dataset (first axis of the input array X).\n2. **Shuffle Indices (Optional)**: If the shuffle parameter is True, shuffle these indices in-place using numpy.random.shuffle.\n3. **Calculate Number of Batches**: The total number of batches is the ceiling of N divided by the batch size. This can be computed as (N + batchsize - 1) // batchsize.\n4. **Create Generator**: The generator should yield slices of the indices array, each of length batchsize (except possibly the last slice). The generator should be single-pass, meaning once all batches are yielded, it should raise StopIteration.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef minibatch(X: np.ndarray, batchsize: int = 256, shuffle: bool = True):\n    \"\"\"Create a generator that yields index mini-batches.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X : np.ndarray\n        Input data of shape (N, *).

This array will be used to reference the samples in the dataset.\n2. **Shuffling Indices**: If the shuffle parameter is set to True, the indices array is shuffled in-place using numpy.random.shuffle. This ensures that the samples are processed in a random order, which is useful for training machine learning models to avoid any bias from the order of the data.\n3. **Calculating Number of Batches**: The total number of batches is determined by dividing the number of samples by the batch size and rounding up. For example, if there are 1000 samples and a batch size of 256, the number of batches will be 4 (1000 / 256 = 3.906, rounded up to 4).\n4. **Creating the Generator**: The generator function, batch_generator, yields slices of the indices array. Each slice starts at the current batch index multiplied by the batch size and ends at the minimum of the next batch index multiplied by the batch size or the total number of samples. This ensures that the last batch can be smaller than the specified batch size if the total number of samples is not a multiple of the batch size.\n5. **Returning the Generator and Batch Count**: The function returns a tuple containing the generator and the total number of batches. The generator will yield each batch of indices one by one when iterated over, and once all batches are exhausted, it will raise StopIteration.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the creation of mini-batches, whether shuffled or not, and provides a clean way to iterate over the dataset in batches, which is a common requirement in machine learning workflows."}
{"task_id": 237, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that calculates the best possible score of a Blackjack hand according to the game's rules. The key challenge is handling the Ace cards, which can be worth either 11 or 1, depending on what benefits the hand the most without exceeding 21 points.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialize Variables**: We'll start by initializing a variable to keep track of the total score and another to count the number of Aces in the hand.\n2. **Process Non-Ace Cards**: For each card in the hand, if the card is a number (2-10), add its face value to the total. If the card is a face card (J, Q, K), add 10 to the total.\n3. **Handle Aces**: For each Ace encountered, increment the Ace count. Aces will be processed after all other cards because their value (11 or 1) depends on the current total score.\n4. **Determine Ace Values**: After processing all non-Ace cards, we need to decide the value of each Ace. The goal is to maximize the total score without exceeding 21. For each Ace, we initially treat it as 11. If adding 11 causes the total to exceed 21, we treat it as 1 instead. This decision is made for each Ace in the hand, one by one.\n5. **Check for Bust**: After processing all cards, if the total score exceeds 21, return 0.

For each Ace, the count is incremented. Face cards (J, Q, K) add 10 to the total, and numeric cards add their respective face values.\n3. **Processing Aces**: After all non-Ace cards are processed, each Ace is evaluated. For each Ace, the code checks if adding 11 to the total would keep the score at or below 21. If so, 11 is added; otherwise, 1 is added. This ensures the highest possible score without busting.\n4. **Bust Check**: After all cards are processed, if the total exceeds 21, the function returns 0, indicating a bust. Otherwise, it returns the total score.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the dynamic value of Aces by deferring their evaluation until after all other cards are processed, allowing for an optimal decision that maximizes the score without exceeding 21."}
{"task_id": 239, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the padding required for a 2-D convolution operation based on the filter size and the desired output shape. The solution involves handling two cases: \"valid\" and \"same\" padding. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Valid Padding**: For \"valid\" padding, no padding is required. The output will be smaller than the input because the convolution is performed without any zero-padding. Hence, the padding values for all sides (top, bottom, left, right) are zero.\n2. **Same Padding**: For \"same\" padding, the goal is to ensure the output size matches the input size when the stride is 1. The padding required for each dimension (height and width) is calculated such that the total padding added is `(filter_size - 1)`. If this value is odd, the padding is split such that the top/left sides get the smaller part (floor division by 2) and the bottom/right sides get the larger part (ceiling division by 2).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef determine_padding(filter_shape: tuple[int, int], output_shape: str = \"same\") -> tuple[tuple[int, int], tuple[int, int]]:\n    \"\"\"Calculate the amount of zero-padding needed on all borders for a 2-D convolution.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    filter_shape : tuple[int, int]\n        (filter_height, filter_width) of the convolution kernel.\n    output_shape : str, optional (default=\"same\")\n        \"same\"  \u2013 pad so that the output spatial dimensions equal the input\n        \"valid\" \u2013 perform the convolution without any zero-padding.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple[tuple[int, int], tuple[int, int]]\n        ((pad_top, pad_bottom), (pad_left, pad_right)) where every value is an\n        integer \u2265 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if output_shape == \"valid\":\n        return ((0, 0), (0, 0))\n    elif output_shape == \"same\":\n        f_h, f_w = filter_shape\n        # Calculate padding for height (top and bottom)\n        pad_h = f_h - 1\n        pad_top = pad_h // 2\n        pad_bottom = pad_h - pad_top\n        # Calculate padding for width (left and right)\n        pad_w = f_w - 1\n        pad_left = pad_w // 2\n        pad_right = pad_w - pad_left\n        return ((pad_top, pad_bottom), (pad_left, pad_right))\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"output_shape must be either 'same' or 'valid'\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Valid Padding Handling**: If the output shape is \"valid\", the function immediately returns `((0, 0), (0, 0))` because no padding is needed.\n2. **Same Padding Handling**: For \"same\" padding, the function calculates the total padding required for each dimension (height and width) as `(filter_size - 1)`. This total padding is split into two parts for each dimension:\n   - **Height Dimension**: The total padding `f_h - 1` is split into `pad_top` (floor division by 2) and `pad_bottom` (remaining padding after assigning `pad_top`).\n   - **Width Dimension**: Similarly, the total padding `f_w - 1` is split into `pad_left` (floor division by 2) and `pad_right` (remaining padding after assigning `pad_left`).\n3. **Result Construction**: The function returns the padding values as a tuple of tuples, `((pad_top, pad_bottom), (pad_left, pad_right))`, which can be directly used to pad the input image accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required padding for both \"valid\" and \"same\" convolution operations, ensuring the output dimensions meet the specified criteria."}

The UCB1 algorithm balances exploration and exploitation by selecting arms based on their empirical reward estimates and an exploration term that accounts for the uncertainty in those estimates.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Unpulled Arms**: The algorithm first checks if any arm has not been pulled yet (i.e., its pull count is zero). If such an arm exists, the algorithm selects the first one encountered (smallest index) to ensure every arm is tried at least once.\n2. **Compute UCB Scores**: If all arms have been pulled at least once, the algorithm computes the UCB score for each arm. The score is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{score}(a) = \\text{ev\\_estimates}[a] + C \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\ln(\\text{current\\_step} + 1)}{\\text{pull\\_counts}[a]}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(C\\) is the exploration parameter, \\(\\text{ev\\_estimates}[a]\\) is the empirical mean reward of arm \\(a\\), and \\(\\text{pull\\_counts}[a]\\) is the number of times arm \\(a\\) has been pulled.\n3. **Select Arm with Highest Score**: The algorithm then selects the arm with the highest UCB score. In case of ties, the arm with the smallest index is chosen.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef ucb1_select(ev_estimates: list[float], pull_counts: list[int], current_step: int, C: float = 1.0) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Return the arm index that UCB1 would pick next.\n\n    PARAMETERS\n    ----------\n    ev_estimates : list[float]\n        Current empirical mean reward for every arm.\n    pull_counts  : list[int]\n        How many times each arm has been pulled so far (same length as\n        ``ev_estimates``).\n    current_step : int\n        The time-step about to be executed.  The quantity *T* in the UCB1\n        formula equals ``current_step + 1``.\n    C : float, default 1.0\n        Exploration parameter.  ``C = 1.0`` recovers the original UCB1.\n\n    RETURNS\n    -------\n    int\n        Index (0-based) of the arm selected by UCB1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check for any arm that hasn't been pulled yet\n    for i in range(len(pull_counts)):\n        if pull_counts[i] == 0:\n            return i\n    \n    # Compute UCB scores for all arms\n    scores = []\n    T = current_step + 1\n    for i in range(len(ev_estimates)):\n        exploration_term = C * math.sqrt(2 * math.log(T) / pull_counts[i])\n        score = ev_estimates[i] + exploration_term\n        scores.append(score)\n    \n    # Return the index of the arm with the highest score, smallest index in case of tie\n    return scores.index(max(scores))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Checking Unpulled Arms**: The loop iterates through each arm's pull count. If any arm has a pull count of zero, the function immediately returns the index of the first such arm encountered. This ensures all arms are explored at least once before any exploitation begins.\n2. **UCB Score Calculation**: For each arm, the UCB score is computed using the empirical mean reward and an exploration term. The exploration term increases with the logarithm of the total steps taken (to ensure exploration decreases over time) and decreases with the number of times the specific arm has been pulled (to prioritize less explored arms).\n3. **Selecting the Best Arm**: The arm with the highest UCB score is selected. The `max` function finds the highest score, and `index` returns the first occurrence of this maximum value, ensuring the smallest index is chosen in case of ties.\n\nThis approach efficiently balances exploration and exploitation, adapting dynamically based on the observed rewards and the number of times each arm has been pulled."}
{"task_id": 243, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the forward pass of a fully-connected Actor-Critic network using NumPy. The network has a shared feature extractor with three dense layers followed by separate actor and critic heads. The weights and biases are all set to 1.0 and 0.0 respectively, which simplifies the computations significantly. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Processing**: The input state is a list of three floats. We will convert this list into a NumPy array for easier manipulation.\n2. **Dense Layers Calculation**: \n   - **First Dense Layer (Dense-1)**: Compute the output by taking the sum of the input state components (since all weights are 1.0 and bias is 0.0), then apply ReLU activation. The ReLU function outputs the maximum of 0 and the input value.\n   - **Second Dense Layer (Dense-2)**: Each neuron in this layer takes the sum of all outputs from the previous layer (again, weights are 1.0 and bias is 0.0), then applies ReLU. Given that all previous outputs are the same, each output here will be 4 times the previous layer's output (since there are 4 neurons in Dense-1).\n   - **Third Dense Layer (Dense-3)**: Similar to Dense-2, each output is 4 times the output of Dense-2, resulting in 16 times the output of Dense-1.\n3. **Actor Head**: The actor head takes the output of Dense-3 (4 neurons) and computes logits by summing these values (weights are 1.0, bias is 0.0). Since all logits are identical, the softmax function will produce equal probabilities for each action (1/3 for each of the 3 actions).\n4. **Critic Head**: The critic head outputs the sum of the Dense-3 outputs (since weights are 1.0 and bias is 0.0), which will be 4 times the output of Dense-3 (64 times the output of Dense-1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef actor_critic_forward(state: list[float]) -> tuple[list[float], float]:\n    \"\"\"Forward pass of a small fully-connected Actor\u2013Critic network.\n\n    Args:\n        state: List of three floats representing the environment state.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple containing:\n            1.

Dense-1: input is s. Each neuron in Dense-1 computes s0*1 + s1*1 + s2*1 + 0 = s0 + s1 + s2. So each of the 4 neurons outputs ReLU(s0 + s1 + s2) = max(0, s0 + s1 + s2). So z1 is this value, and z1_out is an array of 4 elements, each being z1.\n\n2. Dense-2: each neuron in Dense-2 takes the sum of z1_out elements (since each weight is 1.0). So each neuron's input is 4*z1 (sum of four z1's). Then ReLU is applied: max(0, 4*z1). But z1 is already max(0, s0+s1+s2). So if z1 is positive, then 4*z1 is positive. So z2 is 4*z1. z2_out is an array of 4 elements, each being z2.\n\n3. Dense-3: same as Dense-2. Each neuron's input is sum of z2_out elements: 4*z2 = 4*(4*z1) = 16*z1. ReLU is max(0, 16*z1), which is 16*z1 (since z1 is non-negative). So z3 is 16*z1. z3_out is an array of 4 elements, each being z3.\n\n4. Actor head: logits are computed as sum of z3_out elements for each output neuron. Each of the 3 output neurons has weights 1.0, so each logit is sum(z3_out) = 4*z3 = 4*16*z1 = 64*z1. So all three logits are 64*z1. Softmax of three identical values is [1/3, 1/3, 1/3].\n\n5. Critic head: output is sum of z3_out elements (since weights are 1.0 and bias 0.0). So state_value is 4*z3 = 4*16*z1 = 64*z1.\n\nSo the code should reflect this.\n\nBut in the initial code, the logits are computed as sum(z3_out) for each of the 3 output neurons, which is correct. So the logits are [64*z1, 64*z1, 64*z1]. Softmax of this is [1/3, 1/3, 1/3].\n\nThe state value is 64*z1.\n\nSo the code should return ([0.3333, 0.3333, 0.3333], 64*z1 rounded to 4 decimal places).\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nFor example, if the state is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]:\n\n- z1 = max(0, 1+2+3) = 6.\n- z2 = 4*6 = 24.\n- z3 = 16*6 = 96.\n- logits = [4*96=384, 384, 384].\n- action_probs = softmax([384,384,384]) = [1/3, 1/3, 1/3].\n- state_value = 4*96 = 384.\n\nSo the output would be ([0.3333, 0.3333, 0.3333], 384.0).\n\nAnother example: state is [-1, 0, 1].\n\n- z1 = max(0, -1+0+1) = 0.\n- z2 = 0.\n- z3 = 0.\n- logits = [0,0,0].\n- action_probs = [1/3, 1/3, 1/3] (since e^0 / (3*e^0)).\n- state_value = 0.0.\n\nSo the output is ([0.3333, 0.3333, 0.3333], 0.0).\n\nThe code handles this correctly.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the initial code, the way logits are computed is by summing z3_out for each of the 3 output neurons. Since z3_out is an array of 4 elements each being z3, the sum is 4*z3. So each logit is 4*z3. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the solution is correct."}

If any probability or the state value is exactly 0 or 1 after rounding, it is kept to one decimal place (e.g., 1.0 or 0.0).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef actor_critic_forward(state: list[float], params: dict[str, list]) -> tuple[list[float], float]:\n    \"\"\"Compute a forward pass through a three-layer Actor\u2013Critic network.\n\n    The network topology is\n        state \u2192 Dense \u2192 ReLU \u2192 Dense \u2192 ReLU \u2192 Dense \u2192 ReLU \u2192\n        \u251c\u2500 actor head  (Dense \u2192 soft-max)  \u2192 action probabilities\n        \u2514\u2500 critic head (Dense)             \u2192 state value\n\n    Args:\n        state: 1-D list or array containing the current environment state.\n        params: Dictionary with the following keys (all values are Python lists\n                 that describe NumPy-compatible arrays):\n                 'W1', 'b1', 'W2', 'b2', 'W3', 'b3' \u2013 shared layers\n                 'Wa', 'ba'                    \u2013 actor head\n                 'Wc', 'bc'                    \u2013 critic head\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (probabilities, value)\n        probabilities : list of floats \u2013 soft-max of the actor head\n        value         : float          \u2013 scalar output of the critic head\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the state to a numpy array\n    x = np.array(state, dtype=np.float32)\n    \n    # Process the shared layers\n    # Layer 1\n    W1 = np.array(params['W1'])\n    b1 = np.array(params['b1'])\n    x = np.dot(x, W1) + b1\n    x = np.maximum(0, x)  # ReLU\n    \n    # Layer 2\n    W2 = np.array(params['W2'])\n    b2 = np.array(params['b2'])\n    x = np.dot(x, W2) + b2\n    x = np.maximum(0, x)  # ReLU\n    \n    # Layer 3\n    W3 = np.array(params['W3'])\n    b3 = np.array(params['b3'])\n    x = np.dot(x, W3) + b3\n    x = np.maximum(0, x)  # ReLU\n    \n    # Actor head\n    Wa = np.array(params['Wa'])\n    ba = np.array(params['ba'])\n    actor_scores = np.dot(x, Wa) + ba\n    # Softmax\n    exp_scores = np.exp(actor_scores - np.max(actor_scores))  # Numerical stability\n    probabilities = exp_scores / np.sum(exp_scores)\n    \n    # Critic head\n    Wc = np.array(params['Wc'])\n    bc = np.array(params['bc'])\n    value = np.dot(x, Wc) + bc\n    value = value.item()  # Convert to scalar\n    \n    # Rounding probabilities and value\n    rounded_probs = []\n    for prob in probabilities:\n        rounded = round(prob, 4)\n        if rounded == 0.0 or rounded == 1.0:\n            rounded_probs.append(float(f\"{rounded:.1f}\"))\n        else:\n            rounded_probs.append(rounded)\n    \n    rounded_value = round(value, 4)\n    if rounded_value == 0.0 or rounded_value == 1.0:\n        rounded_value = float(f\"{rounded_value:.1f}\")\n    \n    return (rounded_probs, rounded_value)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Conversion**: The input state list is converted into a NumPy array to facilitate matrix operations.\n2. **Shared Layers Processing**: The state undergoes three affine transformations (matrix multiplication followed by bias addition) with ReLU activation applied after each transformation.

If any value is exactly 0 or 1 after rounding, it is formatted to one decimal place for consistency.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input through the network, applying the necessary transformations and activations, and ensures the output is formatted correctly for use in reinforcement learning algorithms."}

This means each element of the gradient vector is the difference between the corresponding elements in the actual and predicted arrays.\n2. **Hessian Calculation**: The Hessian matrix for the least-squares loss is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal entry is the second derivative of the loss with respect to each predicted value.

{"task_id": 253, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that computes either the Elastic-Net penalty or its gradient based on the given parameters. The Elastic-Net penalty is a combination of L1 and L2 regularization terms, and the gradient is derived from the sum of the derivatives of these terms.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Elastic-Net Penalty**: The penalty is given by \\( R(w) = \\alpha \\left[ \\lambda \\cdot ||w||_1 + (1 - \\lambda) \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot ||w||_2^2 \\right] \\). Here, \\( ||w||_1 \\) is the L1 norm (sum of absolute values of the weights), and \\( ||w||_2^2 \\) is the squared L2 norm (sum of squares of the weights). The term \\( 0.5 \\cdot ||w||_2^2 \\) is used to simplify the gradient computation.\n2. **Gradient Calculation**: The gradient of the penalty with respect to \\( w \\) is \\( \\nabla R(w) = \\alpha \\left[ \\lambda \\cdot \\text{sign}(w) + (1 - \\lambda) \\cdot w \\right] \\). The `sign` function returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on the sign of each element in \\( w \\).\n3. **Handling Different Outputs**: The function should return either the penalty value or the gradient based on the `gradient` flag.

The result is scaled by \\( \\alpha \\), each element is rounded to four decimal places, and the result is returned as a list.\n3. **Penalty Calculation**: When the `gradient` flag is False, the function computes the penalty value by summing the absolute values of the weights (L1 norm) and the squared values of the weights (L2 norm squared). These are combined according to the given \\( \\lambda \\) (l1_ratio) and \\( \\alpha \\), then rounded to four decimal places before returning.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both the penalty and gradient computations while adhering to the specified rounding requirements, providing a clear and concise solution."}

If there are none, it immediately returns False because there can't be a usable ace.\n2. **Calculate Total with Usable Ace**: The total value of the hand is calculated by summing all card values, treating all aces as 1. Then, to check if any ace can be treated as 11, the code adds 10 to the total (since changing one ace from 1 to 11 increases its value by 10). If this new total (total_with_usable_ace) is \u2264 21, the hand has a usable ace, and the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.\n   \nThis approach efficiently checks for the presence of a usable ace by leveraging the fact that only one ace needs to be treated as 11 to potentially keep the total under or equal to 21, which is optimal for Blackjack strategy."}

Stumps with lower error rates receive higher weights.\n4. **Weight Update**: After each iteration, the weights of misclassified samples are increased, ensuring subsequent stumps focus more on these harder-to-classify samples.\n5. **Prediction Aggregation**: For test samples, predictions from all stumps are aggregated, weighted by their respective alphas.

The overall loss is the mean of these per-sample losses. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Input Lengths**: First, we need to ensure that the two input arrays (or lists) have the same length.

{"task_id": 259, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that deterministically samples a batch of transitions from a replay buffer using a seeded random number generator. The solution involves checking the buffer size, seeding the random number generator to ensure deterministic behavior, and then sampling the required number of transitions without replacement.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Buffer Size**: First, we need to check if the requested batch size exceeds the length of the replay buffer. If it does, the function should return -1 as specified.\n2. **Seed the Random Number Generator**: To ensure deterministic sampling, we seed the random number generator with a fixed value (42) before performing the sampling.\n3. **Sample Without Replacement**: Using the seeded random number generator, we sample `batch_size` different transitions from the buffer without replacement. The `random.sample` function is used here because it inherently samples without replacement and returns the items in a random order, which meets the requirement of returning them in the order produced by `random.sample`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef sample_replay_memory(memory: list, batch_size: int) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Randomly samples *batch_size* transitions from the replay buffer.\n\n    The selection must be deterministic (use random.seed(42)).

If a wrap width is specified (a positive integer), take the result modulo the wrap width.\n   - **Append Integer Variables**: After processing all floats, append any additional integer variables to the coordinate list.\n3. **Hash Coordinates**: Use a deterministic polynomial hash to convert the coordinate list into an index within the range `[0, ihtORsize-1]`.

For example, a float value of 0.1 with 2 tilings becomes `floor(0.1 * 2) = 0`.\n2. **Tiling Processing**: For each tiling (from 0 to `numtilings-1`), the algorithm starts with the tiling number as the first coordinate. For each quantized float, it computes a coordinate using the formula `(q_i + (b % numtilings)) // numtilings`, where `b` starts as the tiling number. If a wrap width is provided, the result is taken modulo the wrap width. The variable `b` is updated by adding `t*2` after processing each float.\n3. **Integer Variables**: After processing all floats, any integer variables provided are appended to the coordinate list.\n4. **Hashing**: The coordinate list is hashed into an index using a polynomial hash function. The hash starts at 0, and for each coordinate, it updates the index as `(index * 31 + coordinate) % ihtORsize`. This ensures the index falls within the specified range.\n5. **Result Collection**: The indices for all tilings are collected into a list and returned. For example, with inputs as specified in the problem, the function returns `[0, 31]` for the given example.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the wrapping tile coding by systematically processing each tiling, applying the necessary transformations, and hashing the results to produce unique indices for each tiling."}

Then, `fan_in` is `in_channels * receptive_field_size` and `fan_out` is `out_channels * receptive_field_size`.\n2. **Compute the standard deviation**: The standard deviation `s` is calculated as `sqrt(2 / (fan_in + fan_out))`.\n3. **Generate the tensor**: Create a NumPy array of the given shape with values sampled from a normal distribution with mean 0 and the computed standard deviation `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef glorot_normal(shape: tuple[int, ...]) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Generate a NumPy array with Glorot/Xavier normal initialisation.\n\n    Args:\n        shape: Tuple describing the desired tensor shape.

The adjacency list should maintain the order of vertices as per `V` and ensure that each neighbor list is sorted according to their appearance in `V` without any duplicates.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialize the Adjacency List**: Create a list of lists where each sublist corresponds to a vertex in `V` and starts as an empty list.\n2. **Process Each Edge**: For each edge `(u, v)` in `E`, since the graph is undirected, both `u` and `v` are adjacent to each other. For each vertex in the edge, add the other vertex to its adjacency list if it hasn't been added already.\n3. **Maintain Order and Uniqueness**: For each vertex, keep track of its neighbors in a set to avoid duplicates, then convert the set to a list sorted according to their order of appearance in `V`.\n4. **Sort Neighbors by Order in V**: For each vertex's adjacency list, sort the neighbors based on their indices in `V` to ensure the order matches their appearance in `V`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, List, Tuple\n\ndef build_adj_list(V: List[Any], E: List[Tuple[Any, Any]]) -> List[List[Any]]:\n    \"\"\"Convert an undirected graph given by (V, E) to an adjacency list.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    V : List[Any]\n        A list of *unique* vertex identifiers.

This helps in quickly determining the order of vertices for sorting neighbors.\n2. **Adjacency List Initialization**: The adjacency list `adj_list` is initialized as a list of empty lists, one for each vertex in `V`.\n3. **Processing Edges**: For each edge `(u, v)`, both vertices are added to each other's adjacency lists if they are not already present. This ensures the graph is treated as undirected.\n4. **Sorting Neighbors**: Each vertex's adjacency list is sorted based on the indices of the vertices in `V`, ensuring neighbors appear in the same order as they do in `V`. This step guarantees deterministic output and meets the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently constructs the adjacency list while maintaining the specified order and uniqueness constraints, providing a clear and structured representation of the graph."}

{"task_id": 269, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trainable parameters in a two-layer Deep Q-Network (DQN). The network consists of two fully connected (dense) layers with a ReLU activation in between, which does not contribute any trainable parameters. \n\n### Approach\n1. **First Layer Parameters**: The first layer maps the input state vector (with dimensions `state_dimensions`) to 164 hidden neurons. The number of trainable parameters in a fully connected layer is calculated as:\n   - **Weights**: The product of the input dimensions (`state_dimensions`) and the output dimensions (164), i.e., `state_dimensions * 164`.\n   - **Biases**: Each neuron in the output layer has a bias term, so there are 164 biases.\n   - **Total for First Layer**: `(state_dimensions * 164) + 164`.\n\n2. **Second Layer Parameters**: The second layer maps the 164 hidden activations to the action dimensions (`action_dimensions`). Similarly:\n   - **Weights**: The product of the input dimensions (164) and the output dimensions (`action_dimensions`), i.e., `164 * action_dimensions`.\n   - **Biases**: Each neuron in the output layer has a bias term, so there are `action_dimensions` biases.\n   - **Total for Second Layer**: `(164 * action_dimensions) + action_dimensions`.\n\n3. **Total Parameters**: The sum of the parameters from both layers gives the total number of trainable parameters in the network.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trainable_params(state_dimensions: int, action_dimensions: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Return the total number of trainable parameters of the DQN network.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    state_dimensions : int\n        Length of the state (observation) vector.\n    action_dimensions : int\n        Number of possible discrete actions.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    int\n        Total count of trainable parameters (weights + biases).\n    \"\"\"\n    first_layer_weights = state_dimensions * 164\n    first_layer_biases = 164\n    first_layer_total = first_layer_weights + first_layer_biases\n    \n    second_layer_weights = 164 * action_dimensions\n    second_layer_biases = action_dimensions\n    second_layer_total = second_layer_weights + second_layer_biases\n    \n    total_params = first_layer_total + second_layer_total\n    return total_params\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **First Layer Calculation**: The first layer's parameters are computed by multiplying the input state dimensions by the number of hidden neurons (164) for the weights, and adding 164 biases. For example, if the state dimension is 10, the first layer parameters would be `10 * 164 + 164 = 1804`.\n- **Second Layer Calculation**: The second layer's parameters are computed by multiplying the hidden layer size (164) by the number of actions for the weights, and adding one bias per action. For instance, if there are 5 actions, the second layer parameters would be `164 * 5 + 5 = 825`.\n- **Total Parameters**: The sum of parameters from both layers gives the total trainable parameters. In the example above, the total would be `1804 + 825 = 2629`.\n\nThis approach efficiently breaks down the parameter count into manageable parts, leveraging the formula for trainable parameters in fully connected layers, and sums them to get the total."}

Similarly, compute \\( G_R \\) and \\( H_R \\) for the right child.\n3. **Parent Node Metrics**: The parent node's \\( G_P \\) is the sum of \\( G_L \\) and \\( G_R \\), and \\( H_P \\) is the sum of \\( H_L \\) and \\( H_R \\).\n4. **Compute Scores**: Calculate the scores for the left child, right child, and parent node using the formula \\( \\frac{G^2}{H} \\).\n5. **Calculate Gain**: The gain is given by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{G_L^2}{H_L} + \\frac{G_R^2}{H_R} - \\frac{G_P^2}{H_P} \\right) \\).\n6. **Round the Result**: Round the computed gain to four decimal places, ensuring that if the gain is exactly zero, it returns 0.0 (not -0.0).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef xgboost_split_gain(\n    left_true: list[float],\n    left_pred: list[float],\n    right_true: list[float],\n    right_pred: list[float],\n) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute XGBoost split gain for squared-error loss.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    left_true : list[float]\n        True target values of the left child after the split.\n    left_pred : list[float]\n        Current model predictions for those left-child samples.\n    right_true : list[float]\n        True target values of the right child after the split.\n    right_pred : list[float]\n        Current model predictions for those right-child samples.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    float\n        The split gain rounded to 4 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert lists to numpy arrays for easier calculations\n    left_true = np.array(left_true)\n    left_pred = np.array(left_pred)\n    right_true = np.array(right_true)\n    right_pred = np.array(right_pred)\n    \n    # Calculate gradients for left and right children\n    g_left = left_pred - left_true\n    g_right = right_pred - right_true\n    \n    # Sum gradients (G_L and G_R)\n    G_L = np.sum(g_left)\n    G_R = np.sum(g_right)\n    \n    # Hessians are 1 for each sample, so H_L and H_R are counts of samples\n    H_L = len(left_true)\n    H_R = len(right_true)\n    \n    # Parent metrics\n    G_P = G_L + G_R\n    H_P = H_L + H_R\n    \n    # Calculate scores for left, right, and parent\n    if H_L == 0:\n        score_left = 0.0\n    else:\n        score_left = (G_L ** 2) / H_L\n    \n    if H_R == 0:\n        score_right = 0.0\n    else:\n        score_right = (G_R ** 2) / H_R\n    \n    if H_P == 0:\n        score_parent = 0.0\n    else:\n        score_parent = (G_P ** 2) / H_P\n    \n    # Compute gain\n    gain = 0.5 * (score_left + score_right - score_parent)\n    \n    # Round to 4 decimal places and handle -0.0 case\n    rounded_gain = round(gain, 4)\n    if rounded_gain == -0.0:\n        rounded_gain = 0.0\n    \n    return rounded_gain\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Gradient Calculation**: The gradient for each sample is computed as the difference between the predicted value and the true value. This is done for both left and right children.\n2. **Summing Gradients and Hessians**: The total gradient \\( G \\) for each child is the sum of individual gradients. The hessian \\( H \\) for each child is simply the count of samples in that child since each sample's hessian is 1.\n3. **Parent Metrics**: The parent's gradient \\( G_P \\) is the sum of the left and right children's gradients, and the parent's hessian \\( H_P \\) is the sum of the children's hessians.\n4. **Score Calculation**: The score for each node (left, right, parent) is calculated as \\( G^2 / H \\). Special cases where \\( H \\) is zero (though unlikely in practice) are handled to avoid division by zero.\n5. **Gain Calculation**: The gain is derived from the difference between the sum of the children's scores and the parent's score, multiplied by 0.5. The result is rounded to four decimal places, and any negative zero is converted to positive zero to meet the output constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the split gain as per XGBoost's methodology for squared-error loss, ensuring accuracy and proper handling of edge cases."}

These midpoints are the candidate thresholds for splitting the dataset.\n2. **Calculate Parent Entropy**: The entropy of the parent node (the entire dataset before any split) is calculated using the Shannon entropy formula based on the class distribution.\n3. **Evaluate Each Split Point**: For each candidate threshold, split the dataset into left (values less than the threshold) and right (values greater than or equal to the threshold) subsets. Compute the entropy for each subset and then the information gain using the formula provided.\n4. **Select Best Threshold**: Track the threshold that yields the highest information gain.

Unique feature values are identified to determine potential split points.\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: Midpoints between consecutive unique feature values are calculated as candidate thresholds.\n3. **Parent Entropy**: The entropy of the entire dataset (parent node) is computed based on the class distribution.\n4. **Information Gain Calculation**: For each threshold, the dataset is split into left and right subsets. The entropy of each subset is computed, and the information gain is derived by comparing the parent entropy with the weighted sum of the subset entropies.\n5. **Best Threshold Selection**: The threshold with the highest information gain is selected. If multiple thresholds yield the same gain, the smallest one is chosen. If no valid splits exist or no positive gain is found, the function returns (None, 0.0).\n\nThis approach efficiently evaluates all possible split points and selects the optimal one based on information gain, adhering to the constraints and rounding requirements specified."}
{"task_id": 274, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that clips each element of a given numeric vector (either a Python list or a NumPy array) to the interval \\([-5, 5]\\). This means any value below \\(-5\\) should be set to \\(-5\\), and any value above \\(5\\) should be set to \\(5\\). The function should return the clipped values as a Python list while preserving the original order and dimensionality.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Input Type**: The input can be either a Python list or a NumPy array. We need to handle both types appropriately.\n2. **Clip Values**: For each element in the input, check if it is less than \\(-5\\), greater than \\(5\\), or within the interval. Replace the element with \\(-5\\) or \\(5\\) if it is outside the interval, otherwise leave it unchanged.\n3. **Return as Python List**: Convert the result into a Python list before returning, ensuring the output meets the specified constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef small_norm_clip(values):\n    \"\"\"Clip each element of *values* to the closed interval [-5, 5].\n\n    Args:\n        values (list[int | float] | np.ndarray): One-dimensional numeric data.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[float]: A Python list where every element has been limited to the\n            range [-5, 5] while preserving the original order.\n    \"\"\"\n    clipped_values = []\n    for value in values:\n        if value < -5:\n            clipped_values.append(-5.0)\n        elif value > 5:\n            clipped_values.append(5.0)\n        else:\n            clipped_values.append(float(value))\n    return clipped_values\n```\n\nWait, but the function name in the solution code has a typo: it's `small_norm_clip` in the task but `small_norm_clip` in the code. Let me correct that.\n\nAlso, the solution can be optimized using NumPy's clip function if the input is a NumPy array, but the problem requires the output to be a Python list. So, even if the input is a NumPy array, we can use the clip function and then convert the result to a list.\n\nHere's an alternative approach using NumPy's clip function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef small_norm_clip(values):\n    if isinstance(values, np.ndarray):\n        clipped = np.clip(values, -5, 5)\n    else:\n        clipped = [min(max(v, -5), 5) for v in values]\n    return [float(v) for v in clipped]\n```\n\nBut the first solution is straightforward and handles both list and array inputs by iterating through each element. Let's proceed with the first solution, correcting the function name.\n\nThe correct function name is `small_norm_clip`, so the code should be:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef small_norm_clip(values):\n    \"\"\"Clip each element of *values* to the closed interval [-5, 5].\n\n    Args:\n        values (list[int | float] | np.ndarray): One-dimensional numeric data.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[float]: A Python list where every element has been limited to the\n            range [-5, 5] while preserving the original order.\n    \"\"\"\n    clipped_values = []\n    for value in values:\n        if value < -5:\n            clipped_values.append(-5.0)\n        elif value > 5:\n            clipped_values.append(5.0)\n        else:\n            clipped_values.append(float(value))\n    return clipped_values\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The function processes each element in the input `values`, which can be a list or a NumPy array. The solution iterates over each element without distinguishing the input type explicitly, treating each element uniformly.\n2. **Clipping Logic**: For each element, the function checks if the value is outside the interval \\([-5, 5]\\). If it is below \\(-5\\), it is replaced with \\(-5\\); if it is above \\(5\\), it is replaced with \\(5\\). Values within the interval are converted to floats to ensure consistent output type.\n3. **Output Conversion**: The processed values are collected into a new list, which is returned. This ensures the output is always a Python list with elements clipped to the specified range, maintaining the original order.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both list and NumPy array inputs, processes each element individually, and returns the desired output in the specified format."}
{"task_id": 276, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement an additive-smoothed N-gram language model that computes the log probability of a given sentence based on a training corpus.

Punctuation within tokens (like hyphens) is retained.\n2. **Vocabulary Construction**: Collect all unique tokens from the training corpus. If `unk` is True, add the `<unk>` token to the vocabulary. Tokens in the target sentence not found in the training vocabulary are replaced with `<unk>`.\n3. **Padding Sentences**: Each sentence (both in the corpus and the target) is padded with `<bol>` at the beginning and `<eol>` at the end.\n4. **N-gram Counting**: For each sentence in the corpus, generate all N-grams (with their histories) and count their occurrences. Also, count the occurrences of each history (prefix) for N-grams where N > 1.\n5. **Probability Calculation**: For each N-gram in the padded target sentence, compute its smoothed probability using additive smoothing. The probability is calculated as (count of N-gram + k) divided by (count of history + k * vocabulary size).

The vocabulary size V should include all possible tokens, which includes the original vocabulary (processed tokens from the corpus plus <unk> if unk is True) and the padding tokens <bol> and <eol>. So the total vocabulary size is len(vocabulary) + 2, because the original vocabulary is built from the processed tokens of the corpus, which wouldn't include <bol> and <eol> unless they were part of the original tokens (which they shouldn't be).\n\nSo in the code, after processing the corpus tokens, the vocabulary is the set of all processed tokens plus <unk> if unk is True. Then, during padding, <bol> and <eol> are added to each sentence. So the model's vocabulary is the original vocabulary plus these two tokens. Hence, V = len(vocabulary) + 2.\n\nSo the code above should correctly compute V as len(vocabulary) + 2.\n\nAnother potential issue is the handling of total_unigrams for N=1. The total_unigrams should count all tokens in the padded corpus, including <bol> and <eol> for each sentence. In the code, during the processing of each sentence in the corpus, the padded version is [\"<bol>\"] + tokens + [\"<eol>\"], and for N=1, total_unigrams is incremented by len(padded) for each sentence. So that part is correct.\n\nThe rest of the code handles the probability calculation for each N-gram in the target sentence, applying additive smoothing with the given k and vocabulary size V.\n\nThus, the code should correctly implement the specified additive-smoothed N-gram model.\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Token Processing**: Each token in the corpus and target sentence is processed to lowercase and stripped of leading/trailing punctuation. This ensures uniformity in token representation.\n2. **Vocabulary Construction**: The vocabulary is built from all unique tokens in the processed corpus. If `unk` is True, `<unk>` is added to handle unseen tokens in the target sentence.\n3. **Sentence Padding**: Each sentence is padded with `<bol>` at the start and `<eol>` at the end to mark sentence boundaries, which is crucial for N-gram context.\n4. **N-gram Counting**: The code counts occurrences of each N-gram and their histories (prefixes) in the padded corpus. For unigrams, it counts the total number of tokens.\n5. **Probability Calculation**: For each N-gram in the padded target sentence, the smoothed probability is computed using the formula provided. The logarithms of these probabilities are summed to get the final log probability of the sentence.\n6. **Result Rounding**: The final log probability is rounded to four decimal places for the output.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the construction of the language model and computes the desired probability with proper smoothing and logging."}

{"task_id": 278, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to traverse a binary decision tree represented by nested dictionaries. The tree consists of internal nodes and leaf nodes. Internal nodes contain the feature index, threshold, and branches to take based on the comparison of the sample's feature value with the threshold. Leaf nodes contain the value to return when reached.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Leaf Node**: If the current node in the tree has a 'value' key, it means we have reached a leaf node, and we return the associated value.\n2. **Internal Node Handling**: For an internal node, we compare the sample's feature (specified by 'feature_i') against the 'threshold' value. \n   - If the sample's feature value is less than or equal to the threshold, we recursively traverse the 'true_branch'.\n   - Otherwise, we recursively traverse the 'false_branch'.\n3. **Recursive Traversal**: The function calls itself with the appropriate branch until a leaf node is encountered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef evaluate_decision_tree(tree: dict, sample: list[float]):\n    \"\"\"Traverse a binary decision-tree represented by nested dictionaries.\n\n    Args:\n        tree (dict): Root node of the decision tree.

This process continues until a leaf node is reached, ensuring the correct prediction value is returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently navigates the decision tree by leveraging recursive traversal, handling each node according to its type (internal or leaf), and making decisions based on the sample's feature values. The recursion naturally handles the nested structure of the tree, simplifying the traversal logic."}

{"task_id": 280, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the L2 regularization term and its gradient for a given weight vector or matrix. The L2 regularization term is calculated as half the product of the regularization coefficient (alpha) and the sum of the squares of all elements in the weight matrix. The gradient of this term with respect to the weights is simply the product of alpha and the weights themselves.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Regularization Value Calculation**: The regularization value is computed as \\(0.5 \\times \\alpha \\times \\sum_{i} w_i^2\\). This involves squaring each element of the input array, summing all these squared values, multiplying by alpha, and then halving the result.\n2. **Gradient Calculation**: The gradient of the regularization term with respect to the weights is \\(\\alpha \\times w\\). This means each element of the weight array is multiplied by alpha.\n3. **Handling Different Shapes**: The function should work for any shape of the input array (1D, 2D, etc.). The operations (sum for the value and element-wise multiplication for the gradient) naturally handle arrays of any shape.\n4. **Rounding**: The results should be rounded to four decimal places. For the regularization value, this means rounding the resulting float.

The resulting array is then rounded to four decimal places to ensure precision, maintaining the original shape of `w`.\n3. **Handling Zero Alpha**: If `alpha` is zero, the regularization value becomes zero, and the gradient becomes an array of zeros with the same shape as `w`, which is naturally handled by the multiplication operation.\n4. **Rounding**: The use of `np.round` for the gradient and Python's built-in `round` for the scalar ensures that all outputs meet the specified precision requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both the value and gradient computations for L2 regularization, works with arrays of any shape, and ensures the results are correctly rounded to four decimal places."}

If `alpha` is zero, both the penalty and gradient will be zero.\n2. **__call__ method**: This method computes the L1 penalty value for the given weight vector `w`. The L1 norm is the sum of the absolute values of all elements in `w`, multiplied by `alpha`.\n3. **grad method**: This method computes the gradient of the L1 penalty with respect to `w`.

If `alpha` is negative, a `ValueError` is raised.\n2. **__call__ method**: When the instance is called with a weight vector `w`, it checks if `alpha` is zero. If so, it returns 0.0. Otherwise, it computes the sum of the absolute values of all elements in `w` and multiplies it by `alpha`.\n3. **grad method**: This method computes the gradient of the L1 penalty. If `alpha` is zero, it returns an array of zeros with the same shape as `w`. Otherwise, it returns `alpha` multiplied by the sign of each element in `w`, where `np.sign` handles the sign function (returning 0 for zero inputs).\n4. **Factory Function**: The `L1Regularization` function acts as a factory, creating and returning an instance of the `L1Regularization` class with the specified `alpha`.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the computation of both the L1 penalty and its gradient for any shape of the input array, adhering to the mathematical definitions provided.

If not, return -1.\n3. **Compute Linear Kernel**: Perform the matrix multiplication of the reshaped x and the transpose of reshaped y.\n4. **Convert to List**: Convert the resulting NumPy array into a nested Python list using the `tolist()` method and return it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef linear_kernel(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> list | int:\n    \"\"\"Compute the linear kernel (Gram matrix) between two data sets.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : np.ndarray\n        First input data.

Can be 1-D (single sample) or 2-D (multiple samples).\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    list | int\n        The linear kernel matrix as a nested Python list. If *x* and *y* have\n        different feature dimensions, returns -1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Reshape 1-D arrays to 2-D row vectors\n    if x.ndim == 1:\n        x = x.reshape(1, -1)\n    if y.ndim == 1:\n        y = y.reshape(1, -1)\n    \n    # Check feature dimensions\n    if x.shape[1] != y.shape[1]:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Compute the linear kernel\n    K = x @ y.T\n    \n    return K.tolist()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reshape Handling**: The function first checks if either input array is one-dimensional (ndim == 1). If so, it reshapes the array into a row vector (1 x d) using `reshape(1, -1)`, which ensures that the array is treated as a single sample with multiple features.\n2. **Dimension Check**: The function then checks if the number of columns (features) in both matrices match. If they don't, it returns -1 immediately, indicating incompatible dimensions.\n3. **Matrix Multiplication**: The linear kernel is computed by multiplying the reshaped x matrix with the transpose of the reshaped y matrix (y.T). This operation (x @ y.T) results in the Gram matrix where each element (i, j) is the dot product of the i-th sample in x and the j-th sample in y.\n4. **Conversion to List**: The resulting NumPy array is converted to a nested Python list using the `tolist()` method to meet the output requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both single and multiple sample inputs, checks for dimension compatibility, and computes the linear kernel in a straightforward manner."}

The output spatial dimensions are calculated based on the input dimensions, pooling size, and stride.\n   - **Pooling Operation**: For each window in each channel of each sample in the batch, compute the average of the elements in the window. The windows are non-overlapping if the stride equals the pool size, but can overlap if the stride is smaller.\n\n2. **Backward Pass**:\n   - **Gradient Distribution**: The incoming gradient (accum_grad) has the same shape as the output of the forward pass. Each element in this gradient corresponds to a pooled value from the forward pass. During the backward pass, each gradient value is divided equally among all positions in the corresponding pooling window from the forward pass.

The stride (s_h, s_w) determines the step size for the window movement.\n   - For each window, the average of the elements is computed and stored in the corresponding position in the output tensor. The output tensor dimensions are determined based on the input dimensions, pooling size, and stride.\n\n2. **Backward Pass**:\n   - The incoming gradient (accum_grad) has the same shape as the output tensor from the forward pass. Each element in accum_grad is distributed equally to all positions in the corresponding pooling window in the input tensor. This is done by dividing the gradient value by the number of elements in the window (p_h * p_w) and adding this value to each position in the window in the gradient input tensor.\n   - The resulting gradient input tensor has the same shape as the original input tensor X, where each element's gradient is the sum of all gradients distributed to it from all pooled values it contributed to during the forward pass.\n\n3. **Rounding and Conversion**:\n   - Both the pooled output and the gradient input are rounded to four decimal places and converted to Python lists before being returned to meet the specified output constraints. This ensures consistency and precision in the results."}

If not, return -1.\n2. **Convert to NumPy Arrays**: Convert the input lists into NumPy arrays for efficient slicing operations.\n3. **Perform Crossover**: \n   - For the first child, take columns before the cutoff from the first parent and columns from the cutoff onwards from the second parent.\n   - For the second child, take columns before the cutoff from the second parent and columns from the cutoff onwards from the first parent.\n4. **Convert Back to Lists**: Convert the resulting NumPy arrays back to nested Python lists before returning them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef single_point_crossover(parent1: list[list[int | float]],\n                            parent2: list[list[int | float]],\n                            cutoff: int) -> tuple[list[list[float]], list[list[float]]]:\n    \"\"\"Single-point column crossover of two weight matrices.\n\n    Args:\n        parent1: First parent weight matrix as a list of lists.\n        parent2: Second parent weight matrix with the same shape as *parent1*.\n        cutoff:  Column index at which crossover starts (inclusive).\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing the two children matrices as lists.

It then checks if their shapes are identical. If they are not, the function returns -1 immediately.\n2. **Crossover Operation**: Using NumPy's array slicing capabilities, the function constructs the two children matrices. For `child1`, columns before the cutoff are taken from `parent1`, and columns from the cutoff onwards are taken from `parent2`. The process is reversed for `child2`.\n3. **Conversion to Lists**: The resulting NumPy arrays are converted back to nested Python lists using the `tolist()` method before being returned as a tuple.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the crossover operation while ensuring the input matrices are not modified in-place and the results are returned in the required format.

The function should handle case insensitivity and ignore any leading or trailing spaces in the input string.

The keys in this dictionary are in lowercase to match the normalized input.\n3. **Validation and Return**: The function checks if the normalized agent name exists in the dictionary. If it does, the corresponding tuple is returned; otherwise, the function returns -1, indicating an unknown agent.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the mapping with minimal computational overhead, leveraging dictionary lookups which are O(1) in complexity, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand."}

The adjacency dictionary should meet specific requirements, including handling both directed and undirected graphs, ensuring edges appear in both directions for undirected graphs, and sorting neighbor lists alphabetically.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialize the Adjacency Dictionary**: Create an empty dictionary `adj` where each vertex from `G['_V2I']` will be a key with an empty list as the initial value.\n2. **Process Directed Edges**: For each edge in `G['_G']`, add the edge to the adjacency dictionary. Each edge is a tuple `(source_label, target_label, weight)`, so we append `(target_label, weight)` to the list of the source_label in `adj`.\n3. **Handle Undirected Graphs**: If the graph is undirected, for each edge `(u, v, w)`, we also add the reverse edge `(v, u, w)` to ensure the adjacency dictionary represents an undirected graph.\n4. **Sort Neighbor Lists**: For each vertex in `adj`, sort its list of neighbors alphabetically by the neighbor label to ensure deterministic output.\n5. **Return the Result**: The resulting adjacency dictionary will have all vertices, including those with no edges, and neighbor lists sorted as required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple\n\ndef to_networkx(G: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[Any, List[Tuple[Any, float]]]:\n    \"\"\"Convert a custom graph dictionary into a plain adjacency dictionary.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    G : dict\n        A graph represented as a dictionary with the keys:\n          * 'is_directed' (bool)\n          * '_V2I'        (dict mapping vertex label -> index)\n          * '_G'          (list of adjacency lists, each edge is a\n                           tuple (source_label, target_label, weight))\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    dict\n        A dictionary where each key is a vertex label and the value is a list\n        of `(neighbour, weight)` tuples.

If the graph is undirected, the reverse edge is also added to maintain undirected representation.\n3. **Sorting Neighbors**: Each neighbor list in `adj` is sorted alphabetically by the neighbor label using Python's built-in sort function with a lambda that converts the neighbor label to a string for consistent comparison. This ensures the output is deterministic and meets the specified constraints.\n4. **Return Result**: The processed adjacency dictionary is returned, now containing all vertices with their neighbors sorted alphabetically, and edges correctly represented for both directed and undirected graphs.\n\nThis approach efficiently converts the custom graph structure into the desired adjacency dictionary while adhering to the specified constraints."}

For boolean arrays, `True` (which is equivalent to 1) and `False` (equivalent to 0) are acceptable. \n3. **Handle Different Data Types**: The solution must correctly identify binary values regardless of the data type. For instance, a float value like 1.0 or 0.0 should be considered binary.\n4. **Check All Elements**: The function should return `True` only if every element in the array meets the binary condition.\n\nThe approach involves converting the array to a boolean mask where each element is checked for being either 0 or 1.

This ensures that even if the input is a list or another array-like structure, it is treated as a NumPy array.\n2. **Check Binary Condition**: The condition `(x == 0) | (x == 1)` creates a boolean mask where each element is `True` if it is 0 or 1, and `False` otherwise. The `np.all` function checks if all elements in this mask are `True`, meaning every element in the original array is either 0 or 1.\n3. **Return Result**: The result of `np.all` is a NumPy boolean, which is converted to a Python built-in boolean using `bool()` before returning.

The solution involves several steps, including tokenizing sentences, padding them appropriately, counting N-grams and their prefixes, computing probabilities, and handling edge cases.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tokenization and Padding**: For each sentence in the corpus, split it into tokens (words) separated by whitespace. If N > 1, pad the beginning of each sentence with N-1 \"<bol>\" tokens and the end with one \"<eol>\" token. For N = 1 (unigrams), no padding is needed.\n2. **Counting N-grams and Prefixes**: For each sentence in the corpus (after padding if necessary), collect all N-grams and their (N-1)-gram prefixes. Count the occurrences of each N-gram and each prefix across the entire corpus.\n3. **Probability Calculation**: For each N-gram in the padded query sentence, compute the conditional probability using MLE: the count of the N-gram divided by the count of its prefix (for N > 1).

{"task_id": 300, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to efficiently keep track of the top-k elements from a stream of numerical values using a heap data structure. The solution should ensure that we only use O(k) memory and handle each element in the stream in O(log k) time per element. The solution must also handle both the largest and smallest elements based on the specified order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Handle Edge Cases**: If `k` is less than or equal to 0, or the sequence is empty, return an empty list. If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the sequence, return the entire sequence sorted according to the specified order.\n2. **Heap Selection**: \n   - For the **k largest elements**, we use a min-heap. The min-heap will keep the smallest of the top-k elements at the root. For each new element in the stream, if it is larger than the root, we replace the root with the new element and heapify to maintain the heap property. This ensures the heap always contains the k largest elements seen so far.\n   - For the **k smallest elements**, we use a max-heap. However, Python's `heapq` module only provides a min-heap implementation. To simulate a max-heap, we invert the values (store them as negatives) when pushing and popping. The max-heap will keep the largest of the top-k smallest elements at the root. For each new element, if it is smaller than the root (after inversion), we replace the root with the new element and heapify.\n3. **Heap Construction**: Initialize an empty heap. For each element in the sequence, manage the heap size to not exceed k elements by either pushing the element (if the heap hasn't reached size k) or comparing it with the root element and replacing if necessary.\n4. **Result Extraction**: After processing all elements, the heap will contain the top-k elements. For the largest elements, the min-heap needs to be sorted in descending order. For the smallest elements, the max-heap (stored as negatives) needs to be converted back to positive values and sorted in ascending order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\nNumber = Union[int, float]\n\ndef top_k_elements(sequence: List[Number], k: int, order: str = \"largest\") -> List[Number]:\n    \"\"\"Keeps only the k largest or k smallest numbers from *sequence*.\n\n    The function must visit each element exactly once and store no more than\n    *k* items at any time by making use of the heapq module (binary heap).\n\n    Args:\n        sequence: A list of integers or floats representing the data stream.\n        k: The number of extreme values to keep.\n        order: \"largest\" to retain the k biggest values, \"smallest\" to retain\n            the k smallest.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list with at most k numbers sorted according to *order*.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k <= 0 or not sequence:\n        return []\n    \n    n = len(sequence)\n    if k >= n:\n        if order == \"largest\":\n            return sorted(sequence, reverse=True)\n        else:\n            return sorted(sequence)\n    \n    heap = []\n    if order == \"largest\":\n        for num in sequence:\n            if len(heap) < k:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, num)\n            else:\n                if num > heap[0]:\n                    heapq.heappop(heap)\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, num)\n        # The heap is a min-heap of the largest k elements, so we need to sort in descending order\n        result = sorted(heap, reverse=True)\n    elif order == \"smallest\":\n        for num in sequence:\n            # Using max heap by storing negatives\n            if len(heap) < k:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, -num)\n            else:\n                if num < -heap[0]:\n                    heapq.heappop(heap)\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, -num)\n        # The heap contains negatives of the smallest elements, sorted in ascending order after negation\n        result = sorted([-x for x in heap])\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"order must be either 'largest' or 'smallest'\")\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Edge Handling**: The function first checks for edge cases where `k` is non-positive or the sequence is empty, returning an empty list immediately. If `k` is larger than the sequence length, it returns the entire sequence sorted according to the specified order.\n2. **Heap Management**: \n   - For **k largest elements**, a min-heap is used. The smallest element in the heap is at the root. If a new element is larger than this root, the root is replaced, maintaining the heap size at k. This ensures the heap always contains the largest elements encountered.\n   - For **k smallest elements**, a max-heap is simulated using negative values. The largest element (in terms of original values) is at the root. If a new element is smaller than this root (after negation), the root is replaced, maintaining the heap size at k. This ensures the heap always contains the smallest elements encountered.\n3. **Result Preparation**: After processing all elements, the heap is converted into a sorted list. For largest elements, the min-heap is sorted in descending order. For smallest elements, the max-heap (stored as negatives) is converted back to positive values and sorted in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each element exactly once, maintaining optimal memory usage (O(k)) and time complexity (O(n log k)) for each element in the stream."}
{"task_id": 301, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to build a binary search tree (BST) from a list of (key, value) pairs, where the tree is ordered based on the numeric values. The BST is constructed by inserting nodes according to specific rules, and then we perform an in-order traversal to collect the keys in ascending order of their values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Node Class Handling**: The problem states that the Node objects have comparison operators implemented based on their stored values (`val`). We need to create a Node class that can handle these comparisons. Each node will store a key and a value, and the comparisons between nodes will be based on their values.\n2. **BST Construction**: The first pair in the list forms the root of the BST. For each subsequent pair, we create a new node and insert it into the BST. The insertion follows BST rules: if the new node's value is strictly less than the current node's value, we go to the left child; otherwise, we go to the right child.\n3. **In-order Traversal**: Once the BST is constructed, we perform an in-order traversal (left subtree, node itself, right subtree) to collect the keys in ascending order of their values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef inorder_keys(pairs):\n    \"\"\"Build a BST from (key, value) *pairs* and return keys from an in-order traversal.\n\n    Args:\n        pairs (list[tuple[Any, int | float]]): List of (key, numeric value) pairs.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: Keys in in-order (ascending by numeric value).

The comparison methods (`__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`) are implemented to compare nodes based on their `val` attribute.\n2. **BST Construction**: The first pair in the input list initializes the root node. For each subsequent pair, a new node is created and inserted into the BST. The insertion process involves traversing the tree from the root, moving left if the new node's value is strictly less than the current node's value, or right otherwise, until an appropriate empty spot is found.\n3. **In-order Traversal**: The traversal is performed using an iterative approach with a stack. The algorithm processes nodes in the order left subtree, current node, right subtree, which ensures the keys are collected in ascending order of their values. The stack keeps track of nodes to visit, and the loop continues until all nodes are processed.\n\nThis approach efficiently constructs the BST and performs the in-order traversal to return the keys in the required order."}

The solution involves extracting the relevant information from the given parameters and formatting it precisely according to the specified layout.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Determine Previous and Current Elements**: \n   - The previous element is at index `max(ix-1, 0)` in the `params` list. This ensures that if `ix` is 0, the previous element is the same as the current element.\n   - The current element is at index `ix` in the `params` list.\n2. **Extract Relevant Data**: \n   - For both previous and current elements, extract the `mine` (program's output) and `label` (unique identifier) from the tuples in `params`.\n   - Retrieve the corresponding gold-standard outputs from the `golds` dictionary using the labels.\n3. **Construct the Debug String**: \n   - Format the extracted data into the specified string layout, ensuring exact adherence to the required structure, including the number of dashes in the header and footer, line breaks, and the placement of each piece of information.\n   - Append the optional `warn_str` exactly as provided at the end of the gold-standard output for the current label.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef err_fmt(params: list[tuple[str, str]], golds: dict[str, str], ix: int, warn_str: str = \"\") -> str:\n    \"\"\"Format a detailed debugging string comparing your output to gold output.\n\n    The function must follow the exact layout described in the task statement.\n\n    Args:\n        params: List of tuples `(mine, label)`.\n        golds:  Dictionary mapping `label` to expected output.\n        ix:     Current index in `params`.\n        warn_str: Optional extra warning string.\n\n    Returns:\n        A single, multi-line string following the required format.\n    \"\"\"\n    prev_ix = max(ix - 1, 0)\n    prev_mine, prev_label = params[prev_ix]\n    curr_mine, curr_label = params[ix]\n    \n    prev_gold = golds[prev_label]\n    curr_gold = golds[curr_label]\n    \n    debug_str = f\"\"\"------------------------- DEBUG -------------------------\nMine (prev) [{prev_label}]:\n{prev_mine}\n\nTheirs (prev) [{prev_label}]:\n{prev_gold}\n\nMine [{curr_label}]:\n{curr_mine}\n\nTheirs [{curr_label}]:\n{curr_gold}{warn_str}\n----------------------- END DEBUG -----------------------\"\"\"\n    \n    return debug_str\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Determine Indices and Extract Data**: \n   - The previous index is calculated as `max(ix-1, 0)` to handle the case where `ix` is 0, ensuring we don't get a negative index.\n   - The `prev_mine` and `prev_label` are extracted from the `params` list at the previous index.

If `mu` is already a vector, it is used as-is.\n3. **Prior Scale (V) Processing**: The prior scale matrix `V` is processed into its inverse form. If `V` is None, it defaults to an identity matrix. If `V` is a scalar, it is treated as a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. If `V` is a list or tuple, it is converted into a diagonal matrix.\n4. **Posterior Calculation**: The posterior covariance matrix (up to \u03c3\u00b2) is computed using the formula involving the inverse of the prior scale matrix and the design matrix. The posterior mean is then derived using this covariance matrix, the prior mean, and the product of the design matrix with the target vector.\n5. **Rounding and Return**: The posterior mean coefficients are rounded to four decimal places and returned as a list.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles different prior specifications and computes the posterior mean in a numerically stable manner, leveraging matrix operations for clarity and correctness."}

This avoids large values of \\( e^{x} \\) when \\( x \\) is large and positive.\n3. **Rounding and Conversion to List**: Round each computed sigmoid value to 4 decimal places and convert the resulting NumPy array back into a Python list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sigmoid(x):\n    \"\"\"Compute the element-wise logistic sigmoid in a numerically stable way.\n\n    The function must\n        \u2022 Accept a scalar, list, tuple or NumPy array of real numbers.\n        \u2022 Return a Python list with each sigmoid value rounded to 4 decimals.\n\n    Args:\n        x (int | float | list | tuple | np.ndarray): Input value(s).\n\n    Returns:\n        list[float]: List containing the sigmoid of every input element.\n    \"\"\"\n    x_array = np.asarray(x)\n    # Initialize the output array\n    s = np.zeros_like(x_array, dtype=np.float64)\n    \n    # For x >= 0\n    mask = x_array >= 0\n    s[mask] = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x_array[mask]))\n    \n    # For x < 0\n    mask = ~mask\n    s[mask] = np.exp(x_array[mask]) / (1 + np.exp(x_array[mask]))\n    \n    # Round to 4 decimal places and convert to list\n    return [round(val, 4) for val in s.tolist()]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The input \\( x \\) is converted into a NumPy array using `np.asarray(x)`, which ensures that whether \\( x \\) is a scalar, list, tuple, or NumPy array, it is treated uniformly as an array.\n2. **Numerically Stable Calculation**: The solution uses vectorized operations to compute the sigmoid values efficiently. For elements \\( x \\geq 0 \\), it uses the standard sigmoid formula \\( 1 / (1 + e^{-x}) \\). For elements \\( x < 0 \\), it uses the alternative formula \\( e^{x} / (1 + e^{x}) \\) to prevent overflow.\n3. **Rounding and Conversion**: The computed sigmoid values are rounded to 4 decimal places using Python's built-in `round` function. The results are then converted from a NumPy array to a Python list before returning.\n\nThis approach ensures that the sigmoid function is computed in a numerically stable manner for all real numbers, avoiding overflow and underflow issues, while efficiently handling various input types and returning the results in the desired format."}
{"task_id": 307, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to generate a bootstrap sample from the given feature matrix `X` and target vector `y`. A bootstrap sample is created by randomly selecting indices from the original dataset with replacement, meaning some samples may be repeated while others may be left out. The solution involves generating these indices and then using them to create the new samples for both `X` and `y`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Determine the number of samples**: The number of samples to draw is equal to the number of samples in the original dataset, which can be derived from the first dimension of `X` or `y`.\n2. **Generate random indices**: Using NumPy's random number generator, generate an array of indices sampled uniformly with replacement from the range `[0, n_samples)`. This ensures reproducibility if a seed is set beforehand.\n3. **Create bootstrap samples**: Use the generated indices to select the corresponding rows from `X` and `y`. The shapes of the resulting arrays will naturally match the input shapes because indexing with an array of `n_samples` indices will return `n_samples` rows.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef bootstrap_sample(X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:\n    \"\"\"Return a bootstrap sample of the data.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X : np.ndarray\n        Feature matrix of shape (n_samples, ...).\n    y : np.ndarray\n        Target vector (or array) of shape (n_samples, ...).\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]\n        ``(X_sample, y_sample)`` where each has the same shape as its\n        counterpart in the input.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_samples = X.shape[0]\n    idxs = np.random.randint(0, n_samples, size=n_samples)\n    X_sample = X[idxs]\n    y_sample = y[idxs]\n    return X_sample, y_sample\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Number of Samples**: The variable `n_samples` is set to the first dimension of `X` (i.e., the number of rows in `X`), which corresponds to the number of data points.\n2. **Random Indices Generation**: The `np.random.randint` function generates an array of random integers between 0 (inclusive) and `n_samples` (exclusive). The `size` parameter is set to `n_samples`, ensuring we draw exactly `n_samples` indices, some of which may be repeated due to replacement.\n3. **Bootstrap Sampling**: The generated indices are used to index into `X` and `y`, creating new arrays `X_sample` and `y_sample` where each element is randomly selected from the original arrays. The shapes of these new arrays are identical to the original inputs because the number of indices used matches the original sample size.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NumPy's array indexing and random number generation to produce bootstrap samples, which is crucial for ensemble methods like Bagging and Random Forests. The solution ensures reproducibility when a seed is set, as it relies on NumPy's global random number generator."}

We will implement it using the following approach:\n   - **Recursion for Small Values**: For values of x less than 6, use the recursion \u03c8(x) = \u03c8(x + 1) - 1/x to shift x up to a value \u2265 6.\n   - **Asymptotic Expansion for Larger Values**: For x \u2265 6, use the asymptotic expansion: \u03c8(x) \u2248 ln(x) - 1/(2x) - 1/(12x\u00b2) + 1/(120x\u2074) - 1/(252x\u2076).\n\n2. **Compute the Expected Value**: Using the digamma function, compute \u03c8(\u03b3[d, t]) and \u03c8(sum of \u03b3[d, :])), then take their difference.\n\n3. **Round the Result**: Round the resulting value to four decimal places before returning it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef digamma(x):\n    \"\"\"Compute the digamma function using recursion and asymptotic expansion.\"\"\"\n    if x <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"x must be positive\")\n    \n    # Use recursion to shift x to >= 6\n    shift = 0.0\n    while x < 6:\n        shift -= 1.0 / x\n        x += 1.0\n    \n    # Apply asymptotic expansion for x >= 6\n    result = math.log(x) - 1.0 / (2.0 * x)\n    result -= 1.0 / (12.0 * x ** 2)\n    result += 1.0 / (120.0 * x ** 4)\n    result -= 1.0 / (252.0 * x ** 6)\n    \n    # Add the shift accumulated during recursion\n    result += shift\n    return result\n\ndef expected_log_dirichlet(gamma, d, t):\n    \"\"\"Compute the expectation of log X_t for a Dirichlet-distributed vector.\n\n    A Dirichlet random vector X with parameters gamma[d,:] satisfies\n        E[log X_t] = \u03c8(gamma[d,t]) \u2212 \u03c8(sum(gamma[d,:])),\n    where \u03c8 is the digamma function.

This leverages the property \u03c8(x) = \u03c8(x + 1) - 1/x.\n   - **Asymptotic Expansion**: Once x is 6 or larger, the function applies the asymptotic expansion formula to approximate \u03c8(x) accurately. The expansion includes terms up to x\u207b\u2076, providing a good balance between accuracy and computational simplicity.\n\n2. **Expected Value Calculation**:\n   - The function extracts the specific parameter \u03b3[d, t] and the sum of all parameters in the row \u03b3[d, :].\n   - It then computes the digamma values for both \u03b3[d, t] and the sum of the row.\n   - The result is the difference between these two digamma values, rounded to four decimal places for the final output.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required expectation without relying on external libraries, adhering to the constraints and providing an accurate result."}

If they are not, it returns -1, as specified.\n2. **Conversion to NumPy Arrays**: The vectors are converted into NumPy arrays using `np.asarray()`, which handles lists, tuples, and existing arrays seamlessly.\n3. **Vectorized Operations**: The difference between the vectors is computed element-wise, squared, summed up, and then the square root of the sum is taken. This approach leverages NumPy's efficient vectorized operations, which are both concise and performant.\n4. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to four decimal places using Python's built-in `round` function to meet the output constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is both correct and efficient, handling various input types gracefully while providing the desired precision in the result."}

For each example:\n   - Compute the prediction \\(\\hat{y}\\) as the dot product of the current weight vector \u03b8 and the feature vector of the example.\n   - Compute the error \\(e\\) as the difference between the prediction and the actual target value.\n   - Update each weight in \u03b8 by subtracting the product of the learning rate, error, and the corresponding feature value.\n4. **Post-processing**: After completing all epochs, round the weights to four decimal places and return them as a standard Python list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef stochastic_gradient_descent(X: np.ndarray | list, y: np.ndarray | list, learning_rate: float = 0.01, epochs: int = 1000) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Learn a linear model with Stochastic Gradient Descent.\n\n    The function must:\n      \u2022 prepend a bias column of ones to `X`;\n      \u2022 initialise the weight vector \u03b8 with zeros;\n      \u2022 perform `epochs` passes of SGD exactly as detailed in the task description;\n      \u2022 return \u03b8 rounded to 4 decimal places as a Python list.\n\n    Args:\n        X: Feature matrix (m\u00d7n) \u2013 can be a NumPy array or a Python list of lists.\n        y: Target vector (m,) or (m,1) \u2013 can be a NumPy array or a Python list.\n        learning_rate: Learning rate (\u03b1).\n        epochs: Number of epochs (full passes over the dataset).\n\n    Returns:\n        Python list containing the learned parameters [\u03b8\u2080, \u03b8\u2081, \u2026, \u03b8_n].\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert X and y to numpy arrays if they are lists\n    X = np.array(X, dtype=np.float64)\n    y = np.array(y, dtype=np.float64).flatten()  # Ensure y is 1D\n    \n    m, n = X.shape\n    \n    # Add bias column (ones) to X\n    X_bias = np.c_[np.ones(m), X]\n    \n    # Initialize theta with zeros (n+1 elements)\n    theta = np.zeros(n + 1)\n    \n    for epoch in range(epochs):\n        for i in range(m):\n            xi = X_bias[i]\n            yi = y[i]\n            prediction = np.dot(theta, xi)\n            error = prediction - yi\n            theta -= learning_rate * error * xi\n    \n    # Round theta to 4 decimal places and convert to list\n    theta_rounded = [round(val, 4) for val in theta]\n    return theta_rounded\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Data Conversion**: The input `X` and `y` are converted to NumPy arrays to facilitate numerical operations. The target vector `y` is flattened to ensure it is one-dimensional.\n2. **Bias Addition**: A column of ones is prepended to the feature matrix `X` to incorporate the bias term \u03b8\u2080 in the linear model. This transforms `X` from an `m\u00d7n` matrix to an `m\u00d7(n+1)` matrix.\n3. **Weight Initialization**: The weight vector \u03b8 is initialized to zeros with a length of `n+1` (one for each feature plus the bias term).\n4. **SGD Training**: For each epoch, the algorithm iterates over each training example. For each example, it computes the prediction, calculates the error, and updates the weights using the SGD update rule. The update adjusts each weight in the direction that reduces the error, scaled by the learning rate.\n5. **Result Post-processing**: After training, the weights are rounded to four decimal places and returned as a standard Python list, ensuring the output meets the specified constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently implements linear regression using SGD, handling both the bias term and feature weights in a unified manner through vectorized operations, and returns the learned parameters in the required format."}

This means individuals with higher fitness have a higher chance of being selected, and once selected, they are not chosen again in the same selection phase.\n4. **Crossover**: For each pair of parents, produce two children by selecting a random crossover point and exchanging the suffixes of the parent strings.\n5. **Mutation**: Each character in each child string is mutated (replaced by a random valid character) with a given probability (mutation rate).\n6. **Replacement**: The new generation replaces the old one entirely (generational replacement).\n7. **Termination**: The algorithm stops either after a specified number of iterations or if the target string is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport string\n\ndef genetic_algorithm(target: str, population_size: int, mutation_rate: float, iterations: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Evolve a population of random strings towards the *target* string using a\n    basic Genetic Algorithm and return the best string discovered.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    target : str\n        The string the algorithm should try to reproduce.\n    population_size : int\n        Number of individuals maintained in each generation.\n    mutation_rate : float\n        Probability with which each character is replaced by a random\n        character during the mutation step.\n    iterations : int\n        Maximum number of generations the algorithm is allowed to run.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    str\n        The highest-fitness string found during the evolutionary process.\n    \"\"\"\n    np.random.seed(42)\n    \n    # Define the character set: space (0), a-z (1-26), A-Z (27-52)\n    chars = ' ' + string.ascii_lowercase + string.ascii_uppercase\n    char_to_index = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(chars)}\n    target_len = len(target)\n    \n    # Initialize population\n    def generate_individual():\n        return ''.join(np.random.choice(list(chars), size=target_len))\n    \n    population = [generate_individual() for _ in range(population_size)]\n    \n    best_individual = None\n    best_fitness = -np.inf\n    \n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Evaluate fitness for each individual\n        fitness_scores = []\n        for individual in population:\n            total_diff = 0.0\n            for p_char, t_char in zip(individual, target):\n                p_idx = char_to_index[p_char]\n                t_idx = char_to_index[t_char]\n                total_diff += abs(p_idx -

This ensures that strings closer to the target have higher fitness.\n3. **Selection**: Parents are selected using fitness-proportionate selection (roulette-wheel sampling) without replacement. This means each parent is selected based on their fitness relative to the total fitness of the population, and once selected, they can be chosen again in the same generation.\n4. **Crossover**: For each pair of parents, a random crossover point is chosen, and the suffixes of the parent strings are swapped to produce two children.\n5. **Mutation**: Each character in each child string has a probability (mutation rate) of being replaced by a random valid character. This introduces genetic diversity into the population.\n6. **Replacement**: The new generation entirely replaces the old one, and the process repeats for the specified number of iterations or until the target string is found.\n7. **Termination**: The algorithm stops early if the target string is found, otherwise it runs for the maximum iterations.

{"task_id": 322, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss function, which is a common loss function used in binary classification tasks. The BCE loss measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability between 0 and 1. The loss increases as the predicted probability diverges from the actual label.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Clip Probabilities**: To avoid numerical instability (like taking the logarithm of zero), we clip the predicted probabilities to a small interval [\u03b5, 1\u2212\u03b5], where \u03b5 is a very small constant (1e-15 in this case).\n2. **Compute BCE Loss**: The BCE loss is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   L = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ y_i \\cdot \\log(p_i) + (1 - y_i) \\cdot \\log(1 - p_i) \\right]\n   \\]\n   where \\( y_i \\) is the actual label (0 or 1) and \\( p_i \\) is the clipped predicted probability for the ith sample.\n3. **Mean Loss**: The mean of the computed losses across all samples is taken.\n4. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to four decimal places before returning.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nEPS = 1e-15  # small constant for numerical stability\n\ndef binary_crossentropy(actual: np.ndarray, predicted: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute the mean binary cross-entropy loss.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    actual : np.ndarray\n        Ground-truth labels containing only 0s and 1s.\n    predicted : np.ndarray\n        Predicted probabilities for the positive class.

This prevents taking the logarithm of zero, which would result in numerical errors.\n2. **BCE Calculation**: For each element in the arrays, the BCE is computed using the formula \\( y_i \\cdot \\log(p_i) + (1 - y_i) \\cdot \\log(1 - p_i) \\). This formula effectively penalizes the model more when the predicted probability is far from the actual label.\n3. **Mean Loss**: The mean of all individual BCE values is computed to get the average loss over all samples.\n4. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to four decimal places to meet the output constraints, ensuring consistency and readability.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the numerical stability issues and computes the BCE loss as required, providing a clear and concise solution."}

This step ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model training process.\n2. **Bias Term Addition**: A column of ones is added to the feature matrix to account for the intercept term (bias) in the logistic regression model.\n3. **Parameter Initialization**: The model parameters (\u03b8) are initialized to zeros. These parameters will be updated during the gradient descent process.\n4. **Gradient Descent**: For each iteration, the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters is computed. The parameters are then updated in the opposite direction of the gradient, scaled by the learning rate (alpha). This process minimizes the cost function over the specified number of iterations.\n5. **Prediction**: After training, the model computes the probability of each example belonging to class 1 using the sigmoid function. These probabilities are thresholded at 0.5 to produce binary class predictions (0 or 1), which are then converted to a Python list and returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently trains a logistic regression model using batch gradient descent and returns the predicted class labels for the training data."}

The update rule is \\( v_t = \\beta_2 \\cdot v + (1 - \\beta_2) \\cdot g^2 \\).\n3. **Compute bias-corrected estimates**: Since the initial moments are biased towards zero, especially in the initial time steps, we correct them by dividing by \\( (1 - \\beta_1^t) \\) for the first moment and \\( (1 - \\beta_2^t) \\) for the second moment.\n4. **Update the parameter**: The parameter is updated using the formula \\( \\theta' = \\theta - \\alpha \\cdot \\hat{m}_t / (\\sqrt{\\hat{v}_t} + \\epsilon) \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is the learning rate and \\( \\epsilon \\) is a small constant to avoid division by zero.\n5. **Return the results**: The updated parameter, new first moment, and new second moment are returned as Python lists, each rounded to 8 decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef adam_update(\n    param: np.ndarray,\n    grad: np.ndarray,\n    t: int,\n    m: np.ndarray,\n    v: np.ndarray,\n    lr: float = 0.001,\n    beta1: float = 0.9,\n    beta2: float = 0.999,\n    eps: float = 1e-8,\n) -> tuple[list, list, list]:\n    \"\"\"Perform **one** Adam optimisation step.\n\n    Args:\n        param: Current value of the parameter \u03b8 (NumPy array).\n        grad:  Current gradient \u2207\u03b8 (same shape as *param*).\n        t:     Time-step counter **starting at 1**.\n        m:     First moment estimate from the previous step (same shape).\n        v:     Second moment estimate from the previous step (same shape).\n        lr:    Learning rate \u03b1 (default 0.001).\n        beta1: Exponential decay rate for the first moment (default 0.9).\n        beta2: Exponential decay rate for the second moment (default 0.999).\n        eps:   Small constant to avoid division by zero (default 1e-8).\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple containing (updated_parameter, new_moment, new_variance) **as\n        python lists**, each rounded to 8 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Update first moment estimate\n    new_m = beta1 * m + (1 - beta1) * grad\n    # Update second moment estimate\n    new_v = beta2 * v + (1 - beta2) * (grad ** 2)\n    \n    # Compute bias-corrected estimates\n    m_hat = new_m / (1 - beta1 ** t)\n    v_hat = new_v / (1 - beta2 ** t)\n    \n    # Update parameter\n    updated_param = param - lr * m_hat / (np.sqrt(v_hat) + eps)\n    \n    # Convert to lists and round to 8 decimal places\n    updated_param_list = np.round(updated_param, 8).tolist()\n    new_m_list = np.round(new_m, 8).tolist()\n    new_v_list = np.round(new_v, 8).tolist()\n    \n    return (updated_param_list, new_m_list, new_v_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Moment Updates**: The first moment (mean) and second moment (uncentered variance) are updated using the current gradient. The updates are exponentially weighted averages where recent gradients have higher weights.\n2. **Bias Correction**: The initial estimates of moments are biased towards zero, especially when \\( t \\) is small. The bias correction adjusts these estimates by scaling them with \\( 1 - \\beta^t \\), which becomes significant as \\( t \\) increases.\n3. **Parameter Update**: The parameter is updated by moving in the direction of the bias-corrected first moment, scaled by the square root of the bias-corrected second moment plus a small constant \\( \\epsilon \\) to ensure numerical stability.\n4. **Rounding and Conversion**: The results are converted to Python lists and rounded to 8 decimal places to meet the output constraints, ensuring consistency and precision in the returned values.\n\nThis approach efficiently implements the Adam optimization step, handling multi-dimensional parameters and ensuring numerical stability through bias correction and the use of a small constant \\( \\epsilon \\)."}

For example, if N=100 and retain_prcnt=0.2, K will be 20.\n2. **Select the top samples**: The indices of the top K rewards are found using `np.argsort`, which sorts the rewards in ascending order. The top K indices are taken from the end of the sorted array to get the highest rewards. These indices are used to select the corresponding parameter vectors from `theta_samples`.\n3. **Compute mean and variance**: The mean and variance of the retained samples (elite samples) are computed along each dimension (axis=0) using NumPy's `mean` and `var` functions. This gives a vector of means and variances for each parameter dimension.\n4. **Round the results**: The mean and variance vectors are rounded to four decimal places and converted to Python lists before being returned.

{"task_id": 344, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the Huffman coding algorithm, which is a lossless data compression technique. The algorithm involves building a binary tree based on the frequency of each token in the input list, where the most frequent tokens have the shortest codes. The steps involve creating a min-heap, merging nodes, and traversing the tree to generate the codes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Frequency Analysis**: Calculate the frequency of each unique token in the input list.\n2. **Handle Edge Cases**: \n   - If the input list is empty, return an empty dictionary.\n   - If there's only one unique token, assign it the code \"0\".\n3. **Min-Heap Construction**: Create a min-heap where each node is prioritized by frequency, and then by the token's string representation (lexical order) to ensure deterministic behavior.\n4. **Tree Construction**: \n   - Repeatedly extract the two nodes with the smallest frequencies from the heap.\n   - Merge them into a new internal node whose frequency is the sum of the two nodes' frequencies. The merged node's key is an empty string, and it has left and right children.\n   - Push the new node back into the heap.\n   - Continue this process until only one node remains in the heap, which becomes the root of the Huffman tree.\n5. **Code Assignment**: Traverse the Huffman tree from the root to each leaf node, assigning '0' for left edges and '1' for right edges, and collect the codes for each token.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, token, freq, left=None, right=None):\n        self.token = token\n        self.freq = freq\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n    \n    def __lt__(self, other):\n        if self.freq == other.freq:\n            return self.token < other.token\n        return self.freq < other.freq\n\ndef huffman_encode(tokens: list[str]) -> dict[str, str]:\n    if not tokens:\n        return {}\n    \n    frequency = defaultdict(int)\n    for token in tokens:\n        frequency[token] += 1\n    \n    if len(frequency) == 1:\n        token = next(iter(frequency))\n        return {token: \"0\"}\n    \n    heap = []\n    for token, freq in frequency.items():\n        heapq.heappush(heap, Node(token, freq))\n    \n    while len(heap) > 1:\n        left = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        right = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        merged_token = \"\"\n        merged_freq = left.freq + right.freq\n        merged_node = Node(merged_token, merged_freq, left, right)\n        heapq.heappush(heap, merged_node)\n    \n    root = heap[0]\n    codes = {}\n    \n    def traverse(node, code):\n        if node.token != \"\":\n            codes[node.token] = code\n            return\n        if node.left:\n            traverse(node.left, code + '0')\n        if node.right:\n            traverse(node.right, code + '1')\n    \n    traverse(root, \"\")\n    return codes\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Frequency Analysis**: The code first counts how often each token appears in the input list using a dictionary.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: If the input list is empty, it returns an empty dictionary. If there's only one token, it assigns the code \"0\" to that token.\n3. **Min-Heap Construction**: Each token and its frequency are converted into a `Node` object and pushed into a min-heap. The heap is ordered by frequency and then by the token's string representation to ensure consistent behavior.\n4. **Tree Construction**: The algorithm repeatedly extracts the two nodes with the smallest frequencies, merges them into a new node (which becomes their parent), and pushes the new node back into the heap. This process continues until only one node remains, forming the root of the Huffman tree.\n5. **Code Assignment**: The tree is traversed from the root to each leaf node. For each left edge, a '0' is added to the code, and for each right edge, a '1' is added. When a leaf node (containing a token) is reached, the accumulated code is stored in the dictionary.\n\nThis approach efficiently constructs the Huffman tree and generates prefix-free binary codes, ensuring optimal compression based on token frequencies."}

The solution involves several steps: verifying the matrix is square, checking for symmetry within a numerical tolerance, and then verifying all eigenvalues are strictly positive if the matrix is symmetric.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check if the matrix is square**: The matrix must have the same number of rows and columns. If not, it cannot be symmetric or positive-definite.\n2. **Check for symmetry**: A matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its transpose. Due to floating-point precision issues, we use `np.allclose` to check if the matrix and its transpose are close enough within a tolerance of `1e-8`.\n3. **Check positive-definiteness**: For a symmetric matrix, we compute its eigenvalues using `np.linalg.eigvalsh` (which is efficient for symmetric matrices) and ensure all eigenvalues are greater than `1e-8`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_symmetric_positive_definite(X: np.ndarray) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check whether a real matrix is symmetric and positive-definite.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X : np.ndarray\n        A two-dimensional NumPy array representing the matrix to test.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    bool\n        True if *X* is symmetric and positive-definite, otherwise False.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the matrix is square\n    if X.ndim != 2 or X.shape[0] != X.shape[1]:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check symmetry\n    if not np.allclose(X, X.T, atol=1e-8):\n        return False\n    \n    # Compute eigenvalues and check positive-definiteness\n    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvalsh(X)\n    if np.all(eigenvalues > 1e-8):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Square Matrix Check**: The function first checks if the input array `X` is two-dimensional and whether the number of rows equals the number of columns. If not, it immediately returns `False` because non-square matrices cannot be symmetric or positive-definite.\n2. **Symmetry Check**: The function uses `np.allclose` to compare the matrix `X` with its transpose `X.T` within a tolerance of `1e-8`. If they are not close enough, the matrix is not symmetric, and the function returns `False`.\n3. **Positive-Definiteness Check**: For symmetric matrices, the function computes the eigenvalues using `np.linalg.eigvalsh`, which is optimized for symmetric matrices. The function checks if all eigenvalues are greater than `1e-8`. If they are, the matrix is positive-definite, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThis approach efficiently combines these checks to determine if the matrix meets both criteria of being symmetric and positive-definite."}

The solution involves constructing a design matrix where each row corresponds to a polynomial expansion of the original feature up to a specified degree, and then applying the ridge regression formula to compute the coefficients.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Construct the Design Matrix**: For each feature value \\( x \\) in the input vector \\( X \\), create a row in the design matrix that consists of \\( x \\) raised to powers from 0 up to the specified degree.

For example, if \\( X = [1, 2, 3] \\) and degree is 2, the design matrix will be:\n   ```\n   [[1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 2, 4],\n    [1, 3, 9]]\n   ```\n   This matrix allows the model to fit a polynomial of the specified degree to the data.\n2. **Matrix Operations**: The transpose of the design matrix \\( X^T \\) is multiplied by the design matrix \\( X \\) to form \\( X^T X \\). The regularization term \\( \\lambda I \\) is added to \\( X^T X \\) to prevent overfitting, especially when \\( X^T X \\) is close to singular.\n3. **Solving for Coefficients**: The system of linear equations \\( (X^T X + \\lambda I) w = X^T y \\) is solved for \\( w \\) using NumPy's `linalg.solve` function, which efficiently computes the solution to the linear system.\n4. **Rounding**: The coefficients are rounded to four decimal places to meet the output constraints, ensuring precision and readability.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the ridge regression coefficients for polynomial features using matrix operations, providing a robust solution that handles regularization to prevent overfitting."}

The output dimensions (out_h, out_w) are calculated based on the input dimensions, pooling window size, and stride.\n2. **Output Array Setup**: An output array of zeros is initialized with dimensions (N, C, out_h, out_w) to store the max pooling results.\n3. **Nested Loops**: The function iterates over each image in the batch (N), each channel (C), and each possible window position in the output dimensions (out_h, out_w). For each window position, the starting and ending indices in the original image are calculated.\n4. **Max Pooling Operation**: For each window, the maximum value is computed and stored in the corresponding position in the output array.\n5. **Conversion to List**: The resulting NumPy array is converted to a nested Python list using the `tolist()` method before returning.\n\nThis approach efficiently applies the max pooling operation by leveraging NumPy's array operations and ensures the result is returned in the required format.

Let me think again. The dilation affects how the kernel is applied to the input. For example, a 3x3 kernel with dilation 1 becomes 5x5 (because each element is spaced by 1 zero). So when applying the kernel to the input, the effective kernel size is (kernel_rows + (kernel_rows - 1) * dilation) \u00d7 (kernel_cols + (kernel_cols - 1) * dilation). \n\nBut in the im2col approach, the patches extracted from the input should correspond to the effective kernel size. So for each output position (i,j), the input patch is of size effective_kernel_rows \u00d7 effective_kernel_cols \u00d7 in_ch. \n\nBut in the code above, when dilation is >0, the code is trying to create a new_patch of size kernel_rows \u00d7 kernel_cols \u00d7 in_ch by sampling the input with strides of 1 + dilation. This is correct, but the initial patch extraction (before dilation handling) is for the effective kernel size, which is not needed. Instead, the code should directly extract the positions according to the kernel's positions with dilation.\n\nSo perhaps the code should be modified to:\n\nFor each output position (i,j), the top-left position in the input is (i*stride, j*stride). Then, the kernel's positions are determined by the original kernel's indices multiplied by (1 + dilation). For example, for kernel row kr and kernel column kc, the input position is (i*stride + kr*(1 + dilation), j*stride + kc*(1 + dilation)).\n\nSo the patch for this output position is the set of input pixels at these positions for each kr and kc.\n\nThus, the im2col matrix should have columns that are the flattened versions of these patches.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\nFor each output position (i,j):\n\n- For each kr in 0..kernel_rows-1, kc in 0..kernel_cols-1:\n\n   - input_row = i*stride + kr*(1 + dilation)\n\n   - input_col = j*stride + kc*(1 + dilation)\n\n   - if input_row and input_col are within the padded input's bounds, take the value; else zero.\n\nBut this is effectively the same as creating a patch of size kernel_rows \u00d7 kernel_cols \u00d7 in_ch, where each element is sampled from the input with step (1 + dilation) in both directions.\n\nSo the code should:\n\n1. For each output position (i,j):\n\n   a. Initialize a patch of size (kernel_rows, kernel_cols, in_ch).\n\n   b.

Else, zero.\n\n   c. Flatten the patch into a column.\n\nSo the im2col matrix for each example will have columns that are the flattened patches of size kernel_rows * kernel_cols * in_ch.\n\nThus, the im2col matrix's shape is (n_ex, kernel_rows * kernel_cols * in_ch, out_rows * out_cols).\n\nThen, the W matrix is reshaped to (kernel_rows * kernel_cols * in_ch, out_ch).\n\nThe matrix multiplication between im2col_matrix (transposed to (n_ex, out_rows*out_cols, kernel_rows*kernel_cols*in_ch)) and W_reshaped (kernel_rows*kernel_cols*in_ch, out_ch) gives the result of shape (n_ex, out_rows*out_cols, out_ch), which is then reshaped to (n_ex, out_rows, out_cols, out_ch).\n\nSo, the corrected code should:\n\n- Compute the effective kernel size (for determining output dimensions and padding), but the im2col patches are of size kernel_rows \u00d7 kernel_cols \u00d7 in_ch, sampled with step (1 + dilation).\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef conv2D(X: \"np.ndarray\", W: \"np.ndarray\", stride: int, pad, dilation: int = 0):\n    n_ex, in_rows, in_cols, in_ch = X.shape\n    kernel_rows, kernel_cols, _, out_ch = W.shape\n    \n    # Handle dilation\n    if dilation < 0:\n        dilation = 0\n    effective_kernel_rows = kernel_rows + (kernel_rows - 1) * dilation\n    effective_kernel_cols = kernel_cols + (kernel_cols - 1) * dilation\n    \n    # Handle padding\n    if isinstance(pad, str) and pad.lower() == 'same':\n        # Calculate padding to maintain input dimensions\n        pr_total = max(0, (in_rows - 1) * stride + effective_kernel_rows - in_rows)\n        pc_total = max(0, (in_cols - 1) * stride + effective_kernel_cols - in_cols)\n        pr1 = pr_total // 2\n        pr2 = pr_total - pr1\n        pc1 = pc_total // 2\n        pc2 = pc_total - pc1\n        pad = (pr1, pr2, pc1, pc2)\n    elif isinstance(pad, int):\n        pad = (pad, pad, pad, pad)\n    elif isinstance(pad, (tuple, list)):\n        if len(pad) == 2:\n            pr, pc = pad\n            pad = (pr, pr, pc, pc)\n        elif len(pad) == 4:\n            pass\n        else:\n            pad = (0, 0, 0, 0)\n    else:\n        pad = (0, 0, 0, 0)\n    \n    # Apply padding\n    if any(p > 0 for p in pad):\n        X_padded = np.pad(X, ((0, 0), (pad[0], pad[1]), (pad[2], pad[3]), (0, 0)), mode='constant')\n    else:\n        X_padded = X\n    \n    # Compute output dimensions\n    out_rows = (in_rows + pad[0] + pad[1] - effective_kernel_rows) // stride + 1\n    out_cols = (in_cols + pad[2] + pad[3] - effective_kernel_cols) // stride + 1\n    \n    # im2col transformation\n    # Each column is a flattened patch of size kernel_rows * kernel_cols * in_ch\n    im2col_matrix = np.zeros((n_ex, kernel_rows * kernel_cols * in_ch, out_rows * out_cols))\n    \n    for i in range(out_rows):\n        for j in range(out_cols):\n            patch = np.zeros((n_ex, kernel_rows, kernel_cols, in_ch))\n            for kr in range(kernel_rows):\n                for kc in range(kernel_cols):\n                    h_offset = i * stride + kr * (1 + dilation)\n                    w_offset = j * stride + kc * (1 + dilation)\n                    if h_offset < X_padded.shape[1] and w_offset < X_padded.shape[2]:\n                        patch[:, kr, kc, :] = X_padded[:, h_offset, w_offset, :]\n            # Flatten the patch\n            im2col_matrix[:, :, i * out_cols + j] = patch.reshape(n_ex, -1)\n    \n    # Reshape W for GEMM\n    W_reshaped = W.reshape(-1, out_ch)\n    \n    # Perform GEMM: im2col_matrix (n_ex, k, m) * W_reshaped (k, out_ch) -> (n_ex, m, out_ch)\n    result = np.matmul(im2col_matrix.transpose(0, 2, 1), W_reshaped)\n    \n    # Reshape result to (n_ex, out_rows, out_cols, out_ch)\n    result = result.reshape(n_ex, out_rows, out_cols, out_ch)\n    \n    return result.tolist()\n```\n\nThis should correctly handle the dilation by sampling the input pixels with the appropriate step. The im2col matrix is built by extracting the kernel's positions according to the dilation, and then the matrix multiplication is performed.\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Padding Handling**: The code first processes the padding specification, whether it's an integer, tuple, or 'same'. For 'same' padding, it calculates the padding required to maintain the input dimensions post-convolution.\n2. **Dilation Handling**: The effective kernel size is computed considering the dilation, which spaces out the kernel elements. This affects the output dimensions and the positions from which input pixels are sampled.\n3. **im2col Transformation**: For each output position, the corresponding input patch is constructed by sampling pixels with steps determined by the dilation. Each patch is flattened into a column in a matrix.\n4. **Matrix Multiplication**: The reshaped kernel matrix is multiplied with the im2col matrix to compute the convolution result efficiently.\n5. **Result Reshaping**: The result of the matrix multiplication is reshaped to match the desired output dimensions and converted to a Python list before returning.\n\nThis approach leverages the im2col transformation to convert the convolution operation into a matrix multiplication, which is computationally efficient and leverages NumPy's optimized routines."}

A small constant `eps` (epsilon) is added to the predicted probabilities to avoid numerical instability when dealing with logarithms of zero.\n2. **Gradient Calculation**: The gradient of the loss with respect to the softmax output is straightforwardly given by the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true labels, i.e., `y_pred - y`.\n3. **Numerical Rounding**: Both the loss and the gradient values should be rounded to four decimal places before returning them.

The sum of these products is negated to get the loss, which is then rounded to four decimal places.\n3. **Numerical Stability**: The epsilon value is taken from `np.finfo(float).eps`, which is the smallest representable positive number such that `1.0 + eps != 1.0`, ensuring that adding it to `y_pred` avoids taking the logarithm of zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both the loss computation and gradient calculation while ensuring numerical stability and precision through rounding."}

The sum is then doubled to get the coefficient value.\n3. **Orthonormal Scaling**: If enabled, the coefficients are scaled. The first coefficient (k=0) is scaled by \\( \\sqrt{1/N} \\) and the others by \\( \\sqrt{2/N} \\). This scaling ensures the transform matrix is orthonormal.\n4. **Rounding and Conversion**: The coefficients are rounded to four decimal places and converted to a list before returning, meeting the specified output constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the DCT-II coefficients directly from the definition, applies the necessary scaling, and formats the result as required."}
{"task_id": 362, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a given 2-D list or NumPy array into a row-stochastic matrix, where each row sums to 1. The solution involves several steps, including checking for rows that sum to zero (which makes normalization impossible), normalizing each row by its sum, rounding the results to four decimal places, and returning the result as a native Python list.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to NumPy Array**: The input can be a list of lists or a NumPy array. We first convert it into a NumPy array of floats to facilitate numerical operations.\n2. **Check for Zero Rows**: Compute the sum of each row. If any row sums to zero, return -1 immediately because normalization is not possible for such rows.\n3. **Normalize Rows**: For each row that has a non-zero sum, divide every element in the row by the row's sum.\n4. **Round and Convert to List**: Round each element of the resulting matrix to four decimal places and convert the matrix back to a native Python list of lists using the `tolist()` method.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef row_stochastic_matrix(data: list[list[int | float]] | \"np.ndarray\") -> list[list[float]] | int:\n    \"\"\"Convert a numeric 2-D structure into a row-stochastic matrix.\n\n    Each row must sum to 1 after transformation.

This step ensures that whether the input is a list of lists or a NumPy array, it is treated uniformly as a NumPy array.\n2. **Row Sum Check**: The sums of each row are computed. If any row sums to zero, the function returns -1 because division by zero is undefined, making normalization impossible.\n3. **Normalization**: Each element of the array is divided by its respective row sum. The `row_sums[:, np.newaxis]` operation reshapes the row sums into a column vector, enabling broadcasting so each element in a row is divided by the row's sum.\n4. **Rounding and Conversion**: The normalized values are rounded to four decimal places using NumPy's `round` function. The resulting matrix is then converted back to a Python list of lists using the `tolist()` method to meet the output requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion, checks for feasibility, normalizes the rows, and formats the result correctly, ensuring robustness and correctness for the given problem constraints."}

The continuity of a space depends on whether it is a `Box` (continuous) or a composite space (`Tuple` or `Dict`) where all subspaces are `Box` instances. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Action Space Continuity**:\n   - If `tuple_action` is `True`, the action space is considered composite (either `Tuple` or `Dict`). In this case, we need to check all subspaces within the composite space. The action space is continuous only if every subspace is a `Box`.\n   - If `tuple_action` is `False`, simply check if the action space itself is a `Box`.\n\n2. **Check Observation Space Continuity**:\n   - Similarly, if `tuple_obs` is `True`, the observation space is composite, and we need to verify that all subspaces are `Box` instances for the space to be continuous.\n   - If `tuple_obs` is `False`, check if the observation space is a `Box`.\n\n3. **Helper Function for Composite Spaces**:\n   - For composite spaces (`Tuple` or `Dict`), recursively check each subspace to ensure all are `Box` instances.

If `tuple_action` is `False`, it simply checks if the action space is a `Box`.\n\n3. **Observation Space Check**:\n   - Similarly, if `tuple_obs` is `True`, the function checks all subspaces of the observation space. If `tuple_obs` is `False`, it checks if the observation space is a `Box`.\n\n4. **Return Values**:\n   - The function returns a tuple `(cont_action, cont_obs)` where each element is a boolean indicating the continuity of the respective space.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both simple and composite spaces, ensuring accurate continuity checks based on the provided flags."}

The solution involves leveraging NumPy's broadcasting capabilities to efficiently compute the distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Compute the Squared Euclidean Distance**: The squared Euclidean distance between two samples \\(X[i]\\) and \\(X[j]\\) is given by the sum of the squared differences between their corresponding features. This can be expanded as:\n   \\[\n   d(i, j) = \\sum_{k} (X[i, k] - X[j, k])^2 = \\sum_{k} X[i, k]^2 + \\sum_{k} X[j, k]^2 - 2 \\sum_{k} X[i, k] X[j, k]\n   \\]\n   Using matrix operations, this can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   D = (X^2 \\cdot 1^T + 1^T \\cdot X^2 - 2 X \\cdot X^T)\n   \\]\n   where \\(X^2\\) is the element-wise square of \\(X\\), and \\(1\\) is a column vector of ones.

This allows efficient computation of the term \\(S[i] + S[j]\\) for all \\(i, j\\).\n3. **Distance Matrix**: The distance matrix is formed by combining the broadcasted squared norms and the dot product matrix. The formula \\(S[i] + S[j] - 2 \\cdot \\text{dot_product}[i, j]\\) efficiently computes the squared Euclidean distance for all pairs.\n4. **Numerical Stability**: Small negative values, which can arise due to floating-point precision errors, are clamped to zero.

For instance, `X_shape` must be a 4-tuple, `out_dim` a 2-tuple, and `stride` a positive integer.\n2. **Effective Kernel Size Calculation**: The effective kernel dimensions are computed by accounting for dilation. For example, a 3x3 kernel with a dilation of 1 becomes 5x5 because dilation increases the space between kernel elements.\n3. **Total Padding Calculation**: The total padding required for height and width is derived from the convolution output size formula. This formula ensures that after convolution, the output matches the desired dimensions.\n4. **Padding Distribution**: The total padding is split into two parts for each dimension. If the total padding is even, it is split equally. If odd, the extra padding is added to the bottom (for height) or right (for width), following TensorFlow's convention.\n5. **Error Handling**: If the computed padding is negative, it means the desired output size is unachievable with the given parameters, and a `ValueError` is raised.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the necessary padding while adhering to the constraints and conventions specified, ensuring the convolution operation produces the desired output dimensions."}
{"task_id": 376, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given 2-D numeric array is symmetric with respect to its main diagonal. The solution involves checking two main conditions: the matrix must be square, and each element at position (i, j) must be equal to the element at position (j, i) for all valid indices (i, j). Additionally, due to potential floating-point rounding errors, we should use NumPy's `allclose` function to compare elements within a small tolerance.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check if the matrix is square**: The matrix must have the same number of rows and columns. If not, it cannot be symmetric, and we immediately return False.\n2. **Convert the matrix to a NumPy array**: This allows us to leverage NumPy's functions for efficient matrix operations.\n3. **Check symmetry using the transpose**: A matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its transpose. Using NumPy's `allclose` function, we compare the original matrix with its transpose, allowing for minor floating-point discrepancies (within an absolute tolerance of 1e-8).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_symmetric(X: list[list[int | float]]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check whether the given 2-D array *X* is symmetric.\n\n    A matrix is symmetric if it is square and equal to its own transpose.\n\n    Args:\n        X: Matrix represented as a list of lists containing numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the matrix is symmetric, otherwise False.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the input list of lists to a NumPy array\n    try:\n        matrix = np.array(X)\n    except:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the matrix is square\n    if matrix.shape[0] != matrix.shape[1]:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the matrix is symmetric using allclose with the default tolerance (1e-8)\n    return np.allclose(matrix, matrix.T)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Matrix Conversion**: The input list of lists is converted into a NumPy array for easier manipulation and comparison. This step handles any potential issues in converting the input to a matrix format.\n2. **Square Check**: The matrix must have the same number of rows and columns to be considered square. If not, the function returns False immediately.\n3. **Symmetry Check**: Using NumPy's `allclose` function, the original matrix is compared element-wise with its transpose. The `allclose` function checks if all corresponding elements are within a small tolerance (1e-8 by default), which accounts for floating-point rounding errors. If all elements meet this criterion, the matrix is symmetric, and the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions for symmetry while handling numerical precision issues common in floating-point arithmetic."}

This transformation is necessary because the logistic loss function is defined in terms of these transformed labels.\n3. **Gradient Calculation**: The negative gradient for each sample is computed using the formula \\( g_i = \\frac{y'_i}{1 + \\exp(y'_i f_i)} \\). This involves element-wise operations between the transformed labels and the current predictions.\n4. **Rounding and Output**: The computed gradients are rounded to four decimal places for precision and converted to a list before being returned. This ensures the output meets the specified format and precision requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the computation while ensuring correctness through input validation and precise arithmetic operations.

This matrix captures the structure of the graph and is fundamental in spectral graph theory.\n5. **Rounding and Conversion**: The elements of the Laplacian matrix are rounded to four decimal places for precision, and the matrix is converted back to a nested list to meet the output requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the computation while ensuring the input is valid and the output meets the specified constraints."}

The function should take an input array and a list of query positions, then return the samples from the input array corresponding to the nearest integer indices of those positions, clipped to the valid range of the input array's length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Query Positions to Indices**: For each query position in `t`, round it to the nearest integer using NumPy's `around` function, which handles ties by rounding to the nearest even integer.\n2. **Clip Indices to Valid Range**: Ensure the rounded indices are within the valid range of the input array's length, i.e., between 0 and `in_length - 1`.\n3. **Retrieve Samples**: Use the clipped indices to gather the corresponding samples from the input array `X`.\n4. **Convert to List**: Convert the resulting NumPy array into a nested Python list as specified.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef nn_interpolate_1D(X: np.ndarray, t: list[float]) -> list[list[float]]:\n    \"\"\"Nearest-neighbour interpolation for a 1-D multi-channel signal.\n\n    Args:\n        X: A NumPy array of shape (in_length, in_channels) representing the\n           original sampled signal.\n        t: A list (or 1-D array-like) of float coordinates at which the signal\n           should be interpolated.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists containing the interpolated samples.

This ensures that any ties (positions exactly halfway between two integers) are rounded to the nearest even integer, consistent with NumPy's behavior.\n2. **Clipping Indices**: The rounded indices are then clipped to ensure they fall within the valid range of the input array's first dimension (0 to `in_length - 1`). This prevents out-of-bounds errors when accessing the array.\n3. **Retrieving Samples**: The clipped indices are used to index into the input array `X`, retrieving the corresponding samples for each query position. Since `X` can be multi-channel, each sample will be a row from `X` (a vector of length `in_channels`).\n4. **Conversion to List**: The resulting NumPy array of samples is converted to a nested Python list using the `tolist()` method, which matches the required output format.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the interpolation by leveraging NumPy's vectorized operations for rounding and clipping, ensuring both correctness and performance.

This average helps in scaling the learning rate adaptively for each parameter, giving more weight to recent gradients while decaying older ones exponentially.\n3. **Parameter Update**: The parameters are updated by moving them in the direction opposite to the gradient, scaled by the learning rate divided by the square root of the running average plus a small epsilon for numerical stability. This scaling ensures that parameters with larger gradients have smaller effective learning rates and vice versa.\n4. **Rounding and Conversion**: The updated parameters and running average are rounded to four decimal places and converted to regular Python lists to meet the output requirements.

If so, it returns a dictionary with the \"type\" key set to the input string.\n2. **Leaky ReLU Check**: The function uses a regular expression to check if the input string matches the pattern for Leaky ReLU, which includes a parameter \"alpha\". The regex captures the numeric value, converts it to a float, and returns a dictionary with the activation type and the alpha value.\n3. **Affine Check**: Similarly, the function checks for the Affine pattern, which includes \"slope\" and \"intercept\" parameters. The regex captures both numeric values, converts them to floats, and includes them in the returned dictionary.\n4. **Invalid Input Handling**: If the input string does not match any of the valid patterns, the function returns -1, indicating an invalid input.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all specified activation function formats, ensuring correct parsing and validation while converting numeric parameters to floats as required."}

Specifically, it checks if the `step` is negative, `stage_length` is not a positive integer, or `decay` is not positive. If any of these conditions are met, the function returns -1 immediately.\n2. **Current Stage Calculation**: Depending on the `staircase` parameter, the current stage is computed either as a continuous value (smooth decay) or a discrete value (staircase decay). For smooth decay, it uses a floating-point division of `step` by `stage_length`. For staircase decay, it uses integer division to floor the result.\n3. **Learning Rate Calculation**: The learning rate is then calculated by multiplying the `initial_lr` with `decay` raised to the power of the current stage. This follows the exponential decay formula provided.\n4. **Rounding and Return**: The result is rounded to 6 decimal places to meet the output constraints and returned.

This can be done using Euclidean distance.\n\n3. **Core Point Check**: If a point has at least `min_samples` neighbors (including itself), it's a core point. \n\n4. **Cluster Expansion**: From a core point, expand the cluster by adding all directly reachable points (within `eps` distance) and then recursively processing their neighbors if they are also core points.\n\n5. **Labeling**: Points that are not part of any cluster are labeled as noise (-1).\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef dbscan(data: np.ndarray, eps: float, min_samples: int) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Density-Based Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN).\"\"\"\n    n_samples = data.shape[0]\n    labels = [0] * n_samples  # 0 means unvisited\n    cluster_id = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n_samples):\n        if labels[i] != 0:\n            continue  # Skip already visited points\n        \n        # Find all neighbors within eps distance\n        neighbors = []\n        for j in range(n_samples):\n            if np.linalg.norm(data[i] - data[j]) <= eps:\n                neighbors.append(j)\n        \n        if len(neighbors) < min_samples:\n            labels[i] = -1  # Noise point\n            continue\n        \n        # Start a new cluster\n        cluster_id += 1\n        labels[i] = cluster_id\n        \n        # Process all neighbors\n        j = 0\n        while j < len(neighbors):\n            neighbor = neighbors[j]\n            \n            if labels[neighbor] == -1:\n                labels[neighbor] = cluster_id  # Change noise to border point\n            elif labels[neighbor] == 0:\n                labels[neighbor] = cluster_id\n                \n                # Find neighbors of the neighbor\n                new_neighbors = []\n                for k in range(n_samples):\n                    if np.linalg.norm(data[neighbor] - data[k]) <= eps:\n                        new_neighbors.append(k)\n                \n                if len(new_neighbors) >= min_samples:\n                    neighbors += new_neighbors  # Add new neighbors to the list\n            j += 1\n    \n    return labels\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: The `labels` list is initialized to 0, indicating all points are unvisited. `cluster_id` starts at 0 and will be incremented to 1 for the first cluster.\n\n2. **Neighborhood Query**: For each point, we compute the Euclidean distance to all other points to find neighbors within `eps` distance.\n\n3. **Core Point Check**: If the number of neighbors is less than `min_samples`, the point is labeled as noise (-1). Otherwise, it's a core point, and we start a new cluster.\n\n4. **Cluster Expansion**: For each core point, we expand the cluster by processing all its neighbors. If a neighbor is unvisited (0), it's added to the current cluster. If it's a noise point (-1), it's relabeled as part of the current cluster (border point). If the neighbor is a core point (has enough neighbors), its neighbors are added to the list to be processed.\n\n5. **Termination**: The loop continues until all reachable points from the core point are processed, and the algorithm moves to the next unvisited point.\n\nThis implementation efficiently handles the DBSCAN algorithm's requirements without relying on external libraries beyond NumPy for numerical operations."}

The function should handle various input types (NumPy array, list, tuple, float, or int) and return the result based on the specified order, rounded to four decimal places and converted to standard Python types.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Convert the input `x` into a NumPy array if it is a list, tuple, float, or int. This allows us to handle all inputs uniformly using NumPy operations.\n2. **Order Handling**: Check the value of `order`. If it is 0, 1, or 2, compute the corresponding SoftPlus function or its derivative. For any other order, return -1.\n3. **Computation**:\n   - **Order 0 (SoftPlus)**: Compute \\( \\ln(1 + e^x) \\). To avoid overflow for large positive values of `x`, use the identity \\( \\ln(1 + e^x) = x + \\ln(1 + e^{-x}) \\) when `x` is large.\n   - **Order 1 (First Derivative)**: Compute the logistic sigmoid \\( \\frac{e^x}{1 + e^x} \\), which is equivalent to \\( \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\).\n   - **Order 2 (Second Derivative)**: Compute \\( \\frac{e^x}{(1 + e^x)^2} \\), which can also be written as \\( \\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x)) \\) where \\( \\sigma(x) \\) is the sigmoid function.\n4. **Rounding and Conversion**: Round the results to four decimal places and convert the NumPy array back to standard Python types (float or list) using the `tolist()` method.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef softplus(x: \"np.ndarray | list | tuple | float | int\", order: int = 0):\n    \"\"\"SoftPlus activation function and its derivatives.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : float | int | list | tuple | np.ndarray\n        Input data on which SoftPlus or its derivatives will be computed.\n    order : int, optional\n        0  -> SoftPlus(x)\n        1  -> SoftPlus'(x)\n        2  -> SoftPlus''(x)\n        Any other value should make the function return -1.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    float | list\n        Result rounded to 4 decimal places.

This ensures that operations like exponentiation and logarithm can be applied element-wise.\n2. **Order Handling**: The function checks the `order` parameter to determine which computation to perform:\n   - **Order 0**: Computes the SoftPlus function using a numerically stable approach. For large positive `x`, \\( \\ln(1 + e^x) \\) is approximated as \\( x + \\ln(1 + e^{-x}) \\), which avoids overflow.\n   - **Order 1**: Computes the first derivative, which is the sigmoid function. The sigmoid is calculated as \\( e^x / (1 + e^x) \\).\n   - **Order 2**: Computes the second derivative, which is the derivative of the sigmoid function, given by \\( e^x / (1 + e^x)^2 \\).\n3. **Rounding and Conversion**: The results are rounded to four decimal places. If the input was a scalar (float or int), the result is returned as a float. For array-like inputs, the result is converted to a list (or nested lists for multi-dimensional arrays) using the `tolist()` method.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles different input types and orders, providing accurate results while ensuring numerical stability and proper output formatting."}

If not, it returns -1 immediately. It then checks each element in both lists to ensure they are non-negative. If any element is negative, it returns -1.\n2. **Logarithmic Difference Calculation**: For each pair of elements from `actual` and `predicted`, the function computes the difference between their logarithms (using `np.log1p` which computes \\(\\log(1 + x)\\) accurately for values near zero). This difference is squared and added to a running sum.\n3. **Mean and Square Root**: The sum of squared logarithmic differences is divided by the number of elements to get the mean, and the square root of this mean gives the RMSLE value.\n4. **Rounding**: The final RMSLE value is rounded to four decimal places before being returned to meet the specified output constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function adheres to the mathematical definition of RMSLE while handling potential input errors gracefully."}

The solution must adhere to specific exploration rules to ensure the result is deterministic. The algorithm should detect cycles during the DFS traversal and return `None` if a cycle is found. Otherwise, it should return the topological order derived from the DFS post-order traversal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list where each vertex points to its neighbors. The neighbors should be ordered according to their appearance in the `vertices` list to ensure deterministic processing.\n2. **DFS Traversal**: Perform a DFS traversal starting from each unvisited vertex. The order of processing vertices is determined by the input `vertices` list.\n3. **Cycle Detection**: During DFS, maintain a set of vertices currently in the recursion stack. If a vertex is encountered that is already in the recursion stack, a cycle exists, and the function should return `None`.\n4. **Topological Order**: As each vertex finishes processing (i.e., all its neighbors have been visited), it is added to the beginning of the result list. This results in a topological order in reverse post-order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Set, Tuple\n\ndef topological_sort(vertices: list, edges: list[tuple]) -> list | None:\n    \"\"\"Determine a topological ordering of a directed graph.\n\n    The implementation **must** use depth-first search (DFS) and follow the\n    deterministic exploration rule described in the task description.\n\n    Args:\n        vertices: List of vertex identifiers (hashable).\n        edges:    List of directed edges given as 2-tuples (source, target).\n\n    Returns:\n        \u2022 List of vertices in topological order when the graph is acyclic.\n        \u2022 ``None`` when the graph contains at least one directed cycle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Build adjacency list with deterministic neighbor order\n    adj: Dict = {v: [] for v in vertices}\n    for u, v in edges:\n        adj[u].append(v)\n    \n    visited: Set = set()\n    recursion_stack: Set = set()\n    result: List = []\n    \n    def dfs(node):\n        nonlocal has_cycle\n        if node in recursion_stack:\n            has_cycle = True\n            return\n        if node in visited:\n            return\n        visited.add(node)\n        recursion_stack.add(node)\n        # Process neighbors in the order they appear in the adjacency list (which is left-to-right in vertices)\n        for neighbor in adj[node]:\n            dfs(neighbor)\n            if has_cycle:\n                return\n        recursion_stack.remove(node)\n        result.append(node)\n    \n    has_cycle = False\n    # Process vertices in the given order\n    for node in vertices:\n        if node not in visited:\n            dfs(node)\n            if has_cycle:\n                return None\n    # The result is collected in reverse order of finishing times\n    return result[::-1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Graph Representation**: The adjacency list `adj` is constructed from the edges, where each vertex maps to a list of its neighbors. The neighbors are added in the order they appear in the edges list, but since edges are processed in order, the adjacency list respects the left-to-right order of vertices.\n2. **DFS Traversal**: The DFS function processes each vertex by first checking if it is in the recursion stack (indicating a cycle). If not, it marks the vertex as visited and adds it to the recursion stack. It then recursively processes each neighbor in the order they appear in the adjacency list.\n3. **Cycle Detection**: If during DFS a vertex is found in the recursion stack, it means there is a back edge, indicating a cycle. The `has_cycle` flag is set to `True`, and the function returns early.\n4. **Topological Order**: Vertices are added to the result list in post-order (after all their neighbors are processed). The final result is the reverse of this list, which gives the topological order. If a cycle is detected at any point, the function returns `None`.\n\nThis approach ensures deterministic processing by adhering to the specified vertex and neighbor exploration order, leveraging DFS properties to detect cycles and generate the topological sort."}

This step ensures that whether the inputs are lists, tuples, or NumPy arrays, they are treated uniformly as NumPy arrays for subsequent operations.\n3. **Euclidean Distance Calculation**: The Euclidean distance is computed by first finding the element-wise differences between the two arrays, squaring these differences, summing them up, and then taking the square root of the sum. This follows the mathematical formula for Euclidean distance.\n4. **Rounding**: The computed distance is rounded to four decimal places using Python's built-in `round` function and converted to a float to ensure the result is in the desired format.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles different input types, checks for vector length consistency, and accurately computes the Euclidean distance with proper rounding."}

In this case:\n     - The receptive field size is calculated as the product of the last two dimensions (kernel height and width).\n     - The fan-in is the product of the number of input channels (second dimension) and the receptive field size.\n     - The fan-out is the product of the number of output channels (first dimension) and the receptive field size.\n   - For any other shape with at least 2 dimensions, the fan-in and fan-out are simply the first and second dimensions of the shape, respectively.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef glorot_fan(shape: tuple[int, ...] | list[int, ...]) -> tuple[float, float]:\n    \"\"\"Compute fan-in and fan-out for a given weight-tensor shape.\n\n    Your task is to implement this function following the rules described in\n    the problem statement.\n\n    Args:\n        shape: A tuple or list whose first two elements correspond to the input\n            and output dimensions (for 4-D convolutional kernels the layout is\n            `(out_channels, in_channels, kernel_height, kernel_width)`).\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple `(fan_in, fan_out)` with both values returned as floats.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(shape) == 4:\n        # Convolutional kernel case: shape is (out_channels, in_channels, kernel_height, kernel_width)\n        out_channels, in_channels, kernel_height, kernel_width = shape\n        receptive_field_size = kernel_height * kernel_width\n        fan_in = float(in_channels * receptive_field_size)\n        fan_out = float(out_channels * receptive_field_size)\n    else:\n        # All other cases: fan_in is shape[0], fan_out is shape[1]\n        fan_in = float(shape[0])\n        fan_out = float(shape[1])\n    return (fan_in, fan_out)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Convolutional Kernel Handling (4-D Shape)**: For a 4-dimensional shape, the function interprets it as a convolutional kernel with dimensions (out_channels, in_channels, kernel_height, kernel_width). The receptive field size is computed by multiplying the kernel height and width. The fan-in is then the product of in_channels and the receptive field size, while the fan-out is the product of out_channels and the receptive field size.\n- **Other Tensor Shapes**: For any other shape with at least two dimensions, the function directly uses the first dimension as fan-in and the second dimension as fan-out. These values are converted to floats to ensure consistency in the return type.\n- **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple of floats (fan_in, fan_out) as specified, handling both convolutional and other tensor shapes appropriately.\n\nThis approach efficiently distinguishes between different tensor types and computes the required values based on the given rules, ensuring accurate initialization for neural network layers."}

For each element in `y`, set the corresponding column in each row to 1.\n4. **Conversion to List**: Convert the resulting NumPy array into a list of lists before returning it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef to_categorical(y: list[int] | np.ndarray, num_classes: int | None = None) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"Convert class labels to one-hot encoding.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    y : list[int] | np.ndarray\n        A 1-D sequence of non-negative integer class indices.\n    num_classes : int | None, optional\n        Total number of classes.

This allows us to handle both list and array inputs seamlessly.\n2. **Number of Classes Determination**: If `num_classes` is not provided, it is set to the maximum value in `y` plus one. If `num_classes` is provided but is insufficient to cover all classes in `y` (i.e., `num_classes <= max(y)`), the function returns -1 to indicate an error.\n3. **One-Hot Matrix Construction**: A matrix of zeros is created with dimensions (number of samples, num_classes).

{"task_id": 439, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the Apriori algorithm, which is a classic algorithm for mining frequent itemsets in a transactional database. The algorithm follows a breadth-first search strategy, starting with single-item itemsets and progressively generating larger itemsets by joining smaller frequent itemsets and pruning those that contain infrequent subsets.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by finding all frequent 1-itemsets. These are items that appear in at least `min_sup` fraction of the transactions.\n2. **Candidate Generation**: For each subsequent pass (k-itemsets), generate candidate itemsets of size k by joining frequent itemsets of size k-1. The joining is done such that two itemsets of size k-1 are joined if their first k-2 items are identical.\n3. **Pruning**: Prune the generated candidates by checking if all their subsets of size k-1 are frequent. This step leverages the Apriori property that any subset of a frequent itemset must also be frequent.\n4. **Support Counting**: For each candidate itemset, count the number of transactions that contain the itemset. If the support (count divided by total transactions) meets or exceeds `min_sup`, the itemset is retained.\n5. **Termination**: The algorithm terminates when no new frequent itemsets are found in a pass.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef apriori_frequent_itemsets(transactions: list[list], min_sup: float) -> list[tuple]:\n    \"\"\"Find frequent itemsets with the Apriori algorithm.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    transactions : list[list[Hashable]]\n        List of transactions; each transaction is itself a list of items.\n    min_sup : float\n        Minimum support threshold expressed as a fraction (>0 and \u22641).\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    list[tuple]\n        Frequent itemsets ordered by length and then lexicographically.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not transactions or min_sup <= 0 or min_sup > 1:\n        return []\n    \n    total_transactions = len(transactions)\n    min_support_count = min_sup * total_transactions\n    \n    # Initialize frequent itemsets\n    frequent_itemsets = []\n    \n    # Generate frequent 1-itemsets\n    item_counts = {}\n    for transaction in transactions:\n        for item in transaction:\n            item_counts[item] = item_counts.get(item, 0) + 1\n    \n    # Filter items that meet the min support and sort them\n    frequent_k = [tuple([item]) for item in item_counts if item_counts[item] >= min_support_count]\n    frequent_k.sort()\n    frequent_itemsets.extend(frequent_k)\n    \n    k = 2\n    while frequent_k:\n        # Generate candidates of size k\n        candidates = set()\n        # Join step: generate candidates by joining frequent_k with itself\n        for i in range(len(frequent_k)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(frequent_k)):\n                itemset1 = frequent_k[i]\n                itemset2 = frequent_k[j]\n                if itemset1[:-1] == itemset2[:-1]:\n                    new_candidate = tuple(sorted(itemset1 + (itemset2[-1],)))\n                    candidates.add(new_candidate)\n        \n        # Prune step: remove candidates with any (k-1)-subset not in frequent_k\n        pruned_candidates = []\n        for candidate in candidates:\n            # Generate all (k-1)-subsets of the candidate\n            subsets = list(itertools.combinations(candidate, k-1))\n            all_subsets_frequent = True\n            for subset in subsets:\n                if subset not in frequent_k:\n                    all_subsets_frequent = False\n                    break\n            if all_subsets_frequent:\n                pruned_candidates.append(candidate)\n        \n        # Count support for each pruned candidate\n        candidate_counts = {}\n        for candidate in pruned_candidates:\n            candidate_counts[candidate] = 0\n        \n        for transaction in transactions:\n            transaction_set = set(transaction)\n            for candidate in pruned_candidates:\n                if set(candidate).issubset(transaction_set):\n                    candidate_counts[candidate] += 1\n        \n        # Filter candidates that meet min support\n        frequent_k = [tuple(sorted(candidate)) for candidate in candidate_counts \n                     if candidate_counts[candidate] >= min_support_count]\n        frequent_k.sort()\n        frequent_itemsets.extend(frequent_k)\n        k += 1\n    \n    return frequent_itemsets\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts by counting the occurrences of each individual item in the transactions. Items that meet or exceed the minimum support threshold are retained as frequent 1-itemsets.\n2. **Candidate Generation**: For each subsequent pass (k-itemsets), candidates are generated by joining frequent (k-1)-itemsets. The joining condition requires that the first k-2 items of the two itemsets are identical.\n3. **Pruning**: Each candidate is checked to ensure all its (k-1)-subsets are frequent. This step ensures the Apriori property is maintained, improving efficiency by reducing the number of candidates.\n4. **Support Counting**: The support for each candidate is counted by scanning the transactions. Candidates that meet the minimum support are retained as frequent itemsets.\n5. **Termination**: The process repeats until no new frequent itemsets are found in a pass. The results are collected, sorted by length and lexicographically, and returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using the Apriori property, ensuring optimal performance while accurately identifying all frequent itemsets."}

This ensures the tree is balanced.\n2. **Querying the KD-Tree**: The `query_kdtree` function traverses the tree to find the k nearest neighbors. It uses a max-heap to keep track of the closest points encountered. The algorithm prioritizes searching the subtree that would contain the query point based on the current axis, but also checks the other subtree if there's a possibility of closer points existing there.\n3. **Majority Vote**: For each test point, after collecting the k nearest neighbors, the labels of these neighbors are used to perform a majority vote. The label with the highest frequency is chosen, with ties broken by selecting the smallest class index.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using the KD-Tree, significantly speeding up the neighbor search compared to a brute-force method, especially for higher-dimensional data."}

This determines the condition used for splitting the dataset.\n2. **Mask Creation**: \n   - For numeric thresholds, a boolean mask is created where each element is `True` if the corresponding feature value in the specified column is greater than or equal to the threshold.\n   - For non-numeric thresholds, the mask is `True` where the feature value exactly matches the threshold.\n3. **Subset Creation**: The left subset is created by selecting rows where the mask is `True`, and the right subset is created by selecting rows where the mask is `False`.\n4. **Edge Handling**: If either subset is empty (i.e., no rows meet the condition), an empty array with zero rows and the same number of columns as the input is returned to maintain consistency in the output shape.\n5. **Return Result**: The function returns a tuple containing the left and right subsets as NumPy arrays.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both numeric and non-numeric thresholds, ensuring correct splits and proper handling of edge cases where subsets might be empty. The solution leverages NumPy's boolean indexing for concise and efficient array operations."}

This function returns an array where the index represents the class label and the value at that index represents the count of predictions for that class.\n3. **Determining the winner**: `np.argmax` is applied to the counts array to find the class label with the highest count. In case of a tie (multiple class labels with the same maximum count), `np.argmax` naturally selects the smallest class label because it returns the first occurrence of the maximum value in the array.\n4. **Compiling results**: The winning class label for each sample is appended to the result list, which is then returned after processing all samples.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the majority voting process, including tie-breaking by selecting the smallest class label, and returns the results in the required format."}
{"task_id": 451, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier using a KD-Tree for efficient nearest neighbor search. The KD-Tree will help in organizing the training data in a way that allows for faster querying of nearest neighbors compared to a brute-force approach. The solution involves building the KD-Tree from the training data, querying the tree for each test point to find the k nearest neighbors, and then determining the most frequent class label among these neighbors, with a deterministic tie-breaker for cases where multiple labels have the same highest frequency.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Edge Cases**: If the training data is empty or k is less than or equal to zero, return an empty list.\n2. **Build the KD-Tree**: The KD-Tree will be constructed recursively by splitting the data along the median of the dimension with the highest variance at each level of the tree. Each node in the tree will store a point (if it's a leaf) or split the data into left and right subtrees based on a splitting dimension and value.\n3. **Query the KD-Tree**: For each test point, traverse the KD-Tree to find the k nearest neighbors. This involves maintaining a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the k closest points encountered during the traversal. The heap helps efficiently manage the nearest neighbors by replacing the farthest neighbor whenever a closer one is found.\n4. **Determine the Predicted Class**: For each test point, collect the class labels of the k nearest neighbors, count their frequencies, and return the label with the highest frequency.

The median point in the sorted dimension becomes the node, with left and right subtrees containing points below and above the median, respectively.\n2. **KNN Search**: The `knn_search` function performs a nearest neighbor search using the KD-Tree. It uses a max-heap to keep track of the k nearest neighbors encountered during the traversal. The search prioritizes branches likely to contain closer points and checks the opposite branch only if necessary.\n3. **Prediction**: For each test point, the `knn_kdtree_predict` function queries the KD-Tree to find the k nearest neighbors, counts the class labels of these neighbors, and predicts the label with the highest frequency, breaking ties by selecting the smallest label.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using the KD-Tree, making the k-NN classifier scalable for larger datasets compared to a brute-force search."}

This ensures that subsequent operations like array slicing work correctly.\n2. **Threshold Type Check**: The function checks if the threshold is numeric (int or float). If so, it creates a boolean mask where each element in the specified feature column of `X` is compared using the `>=` operator. For non-numeric thresholds, the mask is created using the `==` operator.\n3. **Splitting the Dataset**: Using the boolean mask, the dataset is split into two subsets. The first subset includes all samples where the mask is `True`, and the second subset includes the remaining samples where the mask is `False`.\n4. **Order Preservation and Conversion**: The subsets are converted to Python lists while preserving their original order from the input dataset. The function returns these subsets as a list of two lists.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both numeric and categorical thresholds, ensuring the subsets are split correctly while maintaining the original sample order.

The labels of these k neighbors are then used to determine the majority class, with ties resolved by selecting the smallest label.\n2. **Heap Strategy**: This approach uses a max-heap to keep track of the k smallest distances encountered. For each query point, distances to all training points are computed, but only the k smallest are retained using the heap, improving efficiency over the naive method.\n3. **KD-Tree Strategy**: The training data is organized into a KD-Tree, which allows for efficient nearest neighbor searches. The tree is built by recursively splitting the data along the axis with the largest variance. During the search, the algorithm prioritizes the subtree that contains the query point and checks the opposite subtree only if it might contain closer points than those already found.\n\nEach method efficiently handles the nearest neighbor search, with the KD-Tree method providing the best performance for large datasets due to its logarithmic search complexity. The solution ensures correctness by adhering to the majority voting rule and handling ties appropriately."}

This combines both norms according to the alpha parameter.\n5. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to four decimal places to meet the specified output constraints, ensuring precision and readability.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the computation using vectorized operations, ensuring both correctness and performance, especially for larger weight vectors.

If not, it returns -1 immediately.\n2. **Penalty Calculation**:\n   - For L1, the penalty is the sum of absolute values of the weights multiplied by \\( C \\).\n   - For L2, the penalty is half the sum of squared weights multiplied by \\( C \\).\n3. **Gradient Calculation**:\n   - For L1, each gradient element is \\( C \\) multiplied by the sign of the corresponding weight. The sign function handles positive, negative, and zero values appropriately.\n   - For L2, each gradient element is simply \\( C \\) multiplied by the weight itself.\n4. **Rounding**: The penalty and each element of the gradient are rounded to four decimal places to meet the output constraints.\n5. **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple containing the rounded penalty and gradient list. If the norm is unsupported, it returns -1.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both L1 and L2 regularization, providing the necessary calculations while adhering to precision requirements."}

{"task_id": 469, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to create a factory function `linear_kernel` that returns a callable function. This callable function will compute the dot product (linear kernel) of two input vectors, which can be either Python lists or NumPy arrays. The solution involves handling type conversion, checking vector lengths, and computing the dot product while adhering to specific constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Factory Function**: The `linear_kernel` function will accept any keyword arguments (ignoring them) and return an inner function `f(x1, x2)`.\n2. **Inner Function**: The inner function `f(x1, x2)` will:\n   - Convert the input vectors `x1` and `x2` into NumPy arrays of type float.\n   - Check if the lengths of the two vectors are the same. If not, return -1 immediately.\n   - If the lengths are the same, compute the dot product using `np.inner` and return the result as a Python float (not a NumPy scalar).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef linear_kernel(**kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Return a callable that computes the linear kernel (dot product).\n\n    The factory keeps a flexible signature (accepting **kwargs) so that it can\n    be used interchangeably with other kernel constructors that may require\n    hyper-parameters.\n\n    Returns:\n        Callable[[array_like, array_like], float]: A function `f(x1, x2)` that\n        returns the dot product of `x1` and `x2`.

This allows the function to maintain compatibility with other kernel functions that might require hyperparameters.\n2. **Inner Function `f(x1, x2)`**:\n   - **Conversion to NumPy Arrays**: The inputs `x1` and `x2` are converted to NumPy arrays using `np.asarray` with a data type of float to ensure numerical consistency.\n   - **Length Check**: The function checks if the shapes of the two arrays are the same. If not, it returns -1 immediately, as specified.\n   - **Dot Product Calculation**: If the shapes match, the dot product is computed using `np.inner`, which is then converted to a Python float before returning. This ensures the result is a native Python type rather than a NumPy scalar.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the requirements, ensuring type conversion, proper error handling without exceptions, and correct return types.

{"task_id": 470, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that takes a file path, resolves it to its canonical absolute form, and then returns the directory part of this path. The solution should handle symbolic links, relative paths, and redundant path segments like \"..\" and \".\" correctly, and should not include a trailing separator unless the directory is the root.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Resolve the absolute path**: Convert the given path to an absolute path if it is relative. This can be done using `os.path.abspath`, but this alone does not resolve symbolic links.\n2. **Resolve symbolic links**: Use `os.path.realpath` to resolve any symbolic links in the path, which also normalizes the path by removing redundant separators and up-level references (\"..\" and \".\").\n3. **Extract the directory name**: Use `os.path.dirname` to get the directory part of the canonical path. This function handles the path correctly, returning the parent directory without a trailing separator (except for the root directory).\n4. **Handle edge cases**: Ensure that if the resolved path is the root directory, it is returned as \"/\" without any further modifications.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef get_scriptdir(file_path: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Return the absolute directory that contains *file_path*.\n\n    The function normalises *file_path* by resolving any symbolic links\n    and removing ``..`` / ``.`` path segments, then returns only the\n    directory component of this canonical path.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path: Path string pointing to a file.

The\n        returned path never ends with a path separator (unless it is the\n        root directory).\n    \"\"\"\n    canonical_path = os.path.realpath(file_path)\n    dir_path = os.path.dirname(canonical_path)\n    return dir_path\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Resolving the Canonical Path**: The function first uses `os.path.realpath` to resolve any symbolic links in the provided path. This function also converts the path to its absolute form and normalizes it by eliminating any \"..\" or \".\" segments. For example, if the input is \".././symlink/file.txt\", `os.path.realpath` will resolve it to an absolute path like \"/home/user/dir/file.txt\" (assuming symlink points to /home/user/dir).\n2. **Extracting the Directory**: The function then uses `os.path.dirname` to get the directory part of the resolved path. For instance, if the canonical path is \"/home/user/dir/file.txt\", `os.path.dirname` will return \"/home/user/dir\". If the path is \"/\", `os.path.dirname` will return \"/\".\n3. **Edge Handling**: The solution naturally handles edge cases. For example, if the input path is a directory (even if it ends with a separator), `os.path.realpath` resolves it to its canonical form, and `os.path.dirname` returns its parent directory. For instance, an input \"/home/user/dir/\" (assuming dir is a directory) will be resolved to \"/home/user/dir\", and `os.path.dirname` will return \"/home/user\".\n\nThis approach efficiently meets all the requirements by leveraging Python's standard library functions to handle path resolution and directory extraction robustly."}

All coordinates are rounded to four decimal places before returning the results.\n\nThis approach efficiently generates the required datasets with clear separation between classes, ensuring reproducibility and precise rounding of coordinates."}
{"task_id": 475, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the Adam optimization algorithm for a single update step. The Adam optimizer combines the ideas of momentum and RMSprop, maintaining moving averages of both the gradients and their squared values, and applying bias correction to these estimates before updating the parameters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialize Previous Moments**: If the previous first moment (`m_prev`) or second moment (`v_prev`) is `None`, initialize them to zeros with the same shape as the gradient `grad`.\n2. **Update Moments**: Compute the new first and second moments using exponential moving averages. The first moment (`m_new`) is a weighted average of the previous first moment and the current gradient. The second moment (`v_new`) is a weighted average of the previous second moment and the square of the current gradient.\n3. **Bias Correction**: Since the moving averages are initialized at zero, they are biased towards zero, especially in the initial time steps. To correct this, compute the bias-corrected estimates for both moments.\n4. **Update Parameters**: Use the bias-corrected moments to update the parameters. The update involves scaling the learning rate by the ratio of the bias-corrected first moment to the square root of the bias-corrected second moment, with a small constant added for numerical stability.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef adam_update(w, grad, m_prev, v_prev, t, learning_rate=0.001, b1=0.9, b2=0.999, eps=1e-8):\n    \"\"\"Perform a single Adam optimisation step.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    w : float | np.ndarray\n        Current value of the parameter(s) to be updated.\n    grad : float | np.ndarray\n        Gradient of the loss with respect to ``w``.\n    m_prev : float | np.ndarray | None\n        Previous estimate of the first moment (mean of gradients).\n    v_prev : float | np.ndarray | None\n        Previous estimate of the second moment (uncentred variance of gradients).\n    t : int\n        Time step (must start at 1 and increase by one on every call).\n    learning_rate : float, default 0.001\n        Step size ``\u03b1``.\n    b1 : float, default 0.9\n        Exponential decay rate for the first moment.\n    b2 : float, default 0.999\n        Exponential decay rate for the second moment.\n    eps : float, default 1e-8\n        Small constant added to the denominator for numerical stability.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple\n        ``(w_new, m_new, v_new)`` where:\n        * ``w_new`` \u2013 updated parameters (same shape as ``w``)\n        * ``m_new`` \u2013 updated first moment\n        * ``v_new`` \u2013 updated second moment\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize m_prev and v_prev if they are None\n    if m_prev is None:\n        m_prev = np.zeros_like(grad)\n    if v_prev is None:\n        v_prev = np.zeros_like(grad)\n    \n    # Update first and second moments\n    m_new = b1 * m_prev + (1 - b1) * grad\n    v_new = b2 * v_prev + (1 - b2) * (grad ** 2)\n    \n    # Compute bias-corrected moments\n    m_hat = m_new / (1 - b1 ** t)\n    v_hat = v_new / (1 - b2 ** t)\n    \n    # Update parameters\n    w_new = w - learning_rate * m_hat / (np.sqrt(v_hat) + eps)\n    \n    return w_new, m_new, v_new\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The function checks if the previous moments (`m_prev` and `v_prev`) are `None` and initializes them to zero arrays with the same shape as the gradient if they are. This handles the initial step where no previous moments exist.\n2. **Moment Updates**: The first moment (`m_new`) is updated as a weighted average of the previous first moment and the current gradient. The second moment (`v_new`) is similarly updated using the squared gradient. These updates incorporate the exponential decay rates `b1` and `b2` to give more weight to recent gradients.\n3. **Bias Correction**: The moving averages are biased towards zero initially because they start at zero. The bias correction adjusts these estimates by scaling them with `1 - b1^t` and `1 - b2^t`, where `t` is the current time step. This correction becomes negligible as `t` increases.\n4. **Parameter Update**: The parameters are updated using the bias-corrected moments. The learning rate is scaled by the ratio of the bias-corrected first moment to the square root of the bias-corrected second moment, with a small constant `eps` added to prevent division by zero.\n\nThis approach efficiently combines momentum and adaptive learning rates to provide a robust optimization step suitable for various machine learning tasks."}

The A* algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide its search towards the destination more efficiently than algorithms like Dijkstra's. The key components of A* are the cost function \\( g \\) (the actual cost from the start to the current node) and the heuristic function \\( h \\) (an estimate of the cost from the current node to the destination). The priority for each node in the priority queue is \\( f = g + h \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by checking if the start or destination positions are obstacles.

If not, it explores each valid neighboring cell (within bounds and not an obstacle). For each neighbor, if a better path (lower \\( g \\) value) is found, it updates the neighbor's \\( g \\) value and adds it to the queue with the new \\( f \\) value.\n4. **Termination**: The loop exits when the destination is found (returning the path length) or the queue is exhausted (returning -1 if no path exists).\n\nThis approach efficiently navigates the grid, prioritizing paths likely to lead to the destination quickly, while ensuring optimality by always expanding the least costly path first according to the combined \\( f \\) value."}

This gives a vector of means where each element corresponds to a feature's mean.\n4. **Variance Calculation**: For each element in the dataset, the squared difference from its feature's mean is computed. These squared differences are summed up for each feature and divided by the number of samples (n_samples) to get the population variance.\n5. **Standard Deviation**: The square root of each variance value gives the population standard deviation for each feature.\n6. **Rounding and Conversion**: The standard deviations are rounded to four decimal places and converted from a NumPy array to a Python list before returning.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the computation without directly using NumPy's built-in standard deviation or variance functions, adhering to the problem constraints.

{"task_id": 481, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement DBSCAN from scratch, we need to follow the algorithm's steps carefully. The key steps involve identifying core points, expanding clusters from these core points, assigning border points to clusters, and marking noise points. Here's a detailed approach:\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with all points unvisited. For each point, if it hasn't been visited, check if it's a core point.\n2. **Core Point Check**: A point is a core point if it has at least `min_samples` points (including itself) within the `eps` radius.\n3. **Cluster Expansion**: For each core point, perform a region query to find all reachable points within `eps`. If the point is unvisited, mark it as visited and add it to the current cluster. If the point is a core point, recursively expand the cluster to include all its reachable points.\n4. **Border Points**: Non-core points that are reachable from a core point are assigned to the cluster of the core point.\n5. **Noise Points**: Points that are not reachable from any core point are labeled as noise (-1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef dbscan(data: np.ndarray, eps: float, min_samples: int) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Cluster *data* with the DBSCAN algorithm.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    data : np.ndarray\n        Two-dimensional array where each row is a sample and columns are\n        features.\n    eps : float\n        Maximum radius of the neighborhood to be considered reachable.\n    min_samples : int\n        Minimum number of samples (including the point itself) required to form\n        a dense region.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    list[int]\n        Cluster labels for each sample.

If it is, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it initializes all labels to -1 (indicating noise) and sets the initial cluster ID to 0.\n2. **Core Point Identification**: For each unvisited point, the algorithm checks if it has at least `min_samples` neighbors within the `eps` radius. If it does, it marks the point as part of a new cluster (starting with cluster ID 0).\n3. **Cluster Expansion**: The algorithm then expands the cluster by checking all reachable points from the core point. If any of these points are also core points, their neighbors are added to the current cluster. This process continues until no more points can be added to the cluster.\n4. **Border Points and Noise**: Points that are reachable from a core point but do not have enough neighbors to be core points themselves are marked as border points and assigned to the current cluster. Points that are not reachable from any core point remain labeled as noise (-1).\n5. **Cluster ID Increment**: Each time a new cluster is discovered, the cluster ID is incremented, ensuring clusters are numbered sequentially in the order they are discovered.\n\nThis approach efficiently groups points into clusters based on density, handles noise appropriately, and follows the DBSCAN algorithm's core principles without relying on external libraries."}

{"task_id": 484, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement Lasso regression for one-dimensional input data with polynomial feature expansion using coordinate descent.

This includes adding a bias term (a column of ones) corresponding to the zero-degree term.\n2. **Coordinate Descent for Lasso Regression**: For each iteration, update each weight in the weight vector sequentially. The update involves:\n   - **Calculating \\( \\rho_j \\)**: For each feature \\( j \\), compute \\( \\rho_j \\) which is the correlation between the feature and the current residuals.\n   - **Soft-thresholding**: Apply the soft-thresholding operator to \\( \\rho_j \\) for weights other than the bias term (which is not regularized) to enforce sparsity.\n   - **Updating the Weight**: The new weight \\( w_j \\) is set to \\( S(\\rho_j, \\lambda) / z_j \\), where \\( z_j \\) is the sum of squares of the \\( j \\)-th feature.\n3. **Prediction**: After training the model, use the learned weights to predict the target values for the test data, which is also expanded into polynomial features.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef lasso_regression_predict(\n    X_train: list[float | int],\n    y_train: list[float | int],\n    X_test: list[float | int],\n    degree: int,\n    reg_factor: float = 0.1,\n    n_iterations: int = 1000,\n) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Fit a one-dimensional Lasso regression model and predict on new data.\n\n    Args:\n        X_train: List of scalar training inputs.\n        y_train: Target values corresponding to `X_train`.\n        X_test:  Inputs on which the trained model is evaluated.\n        degree:  Highest polynomial degree used for the feature expansion.\n        reg_factor: Non-negative regularisation strength (\u03bb).\n        n_iterations: Number of coordinate-descent sweeps.\n\n    Returns:\n        List of predictions for every element in `X_test`, each rounded to\n        the 4th decimal place.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert inputs to numpy arrays for easier manipulation\n    X_train = np.array(X_train, dtype=np.float64)\n    y_train = np.array(y_train, dtype=np.float64)\n    X_test = np.array(X_test, dtype=np.float64)\n    \n    # Create polynomial features for training and test data\n    def polynomial_features(X, degree):\n        n_samples = len(X)\n        features = np.ones((n_samples, degree + 1))\n        for d in range(1, degree + 1):\n            features[:, d] = X ** d\n        return features\n    \n    Phi_train = polynomial_features(X_train, degree)\n    Phi_test = polynomial_features(X_test, degree)\n    \n    n_samples, n_features = Phi_train.shape\n    w = np.zeros(n_features)  # Initialize weights to zero\n    \n    for _ in range(n_iterations):\n        for j in range(n_features):\n            # Compute the current prediction without the j-th feature\n            y_pred = Phi_train @ w\n            residual = y_train - (y_pred - Phi_train[:, j] * w[j])\n            \n            # Compute rho_j and z_j\n            rho_j = np.dot(Phi_train[:, j], residual)\n            z_j = np.sum(Phi_train[:, j] ** 2)\n            \n            if j == 0:  # bias term, no regularization\n                w_j_new = rho_j / z_j\n            else:\n                # Apply soft-thresholding\n                if z_j == 0:\n                    w_j_new = 0.0\n                else:\n                    soft_threshold = np.sign(rho_j) * max(abs(rho_j) - reg_factor, 0)\n                    w_j_new = soft_threshold / z_j\n            \n            w[j] = w_j_new\n    \n    # Predict on test data\n    y_pred_test = Phi_test @ w\n    # Round to 4 decimal places and convert to list\n    predictions = [round(y, 4) for y in y_pred_test]\n    \n    return predictions\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Polynomial Feature Expansion**: The function `polynomial_features` generates a matrix where each column represents the input data raised to a power from 0 (bias term) up to the specified degree. For example, if the input is [1, 2] and degree is 2, the features for each element will be [1, x, x^2].\n2. **Coordinate Descent**: The algorithm iterates over each weight \\( w_j \\) in each iteration. For each \\( j \\), it calculates the residual without the contribution of \\( w_j \\), then updates \\( w_j \\) based on the correlation between the feature and the residual. The bias term (j=0) is updated without regularization, while other weights are updated using the soft-thresholding operator to enforce sparsity.\n3. **Prediction**: After training, the model uses the learned weights to predict the target values for the test data, which is also expanded into polynomial features. The predictions are rounded to four decimal places before returning.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the L1 regularization via coordinate descent, ensuring sparsity in the weight vector while fitting the polynomial features to the training data. The predictions are then made on the test data using the trained model."}

The best split is the one that minimizes the SSE of the two resulting child nodes.\n3. **Stopping Conditions**: Stop splitting if the node depth reaches the maximum depth or the node has fewer than two samples.\n4. **Prediction**: For each test point, traverse the tree from the root to a leaf node, using the split thresholds to guide the path, and return the leaf node's predicted value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef regression_tree_predict(X_train: list[float | int],\n                           y_train: list[float | int],\n                           X_test:  list[float | int],\n                           max_depth: int = 3) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Fit a univariate regression tree of depth *max_depth* and predict.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X_train : list[float | int]\n        1-D feature values for the training set.\n    y_train : list[float | int]\n        Continuous target values for the training set.\n    X_test : list[float | int]\n        1-D feature values for which predictions are required.\n    max_depth : int, default 3\n        Maximum depth of the binary tree (root has depth 0).\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    list[float]\n        Predictions for every element in *X_test*.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not X_train or not y_train:\n        return []\n    \n    X_train = np.array(X_train)\n    y_train = np.array(y_train)\n    \n    # Define a tree node structure\n    class TreeNode:\n        def __init__(self, depth):\n            self.depth = depth\n            self.threshold = None\n            self.left = None\n            self.right = None\n            self.value = None  # for leaves\n    \n    def build_tree(X, y, depth):\n        node = TreeNode(depth)\n        \n        if depth >= max_depth or len(X) < 2:\n            node.value = np.mean(y)\n            return node\n        \n        best_sse = float('inf')\n        best_threshold = None\n        best_left_indices = None\n        best_right_indices = None\n        \n        # Sort X and y based on X values to find possible splits\n        sorted_indices = np.argsort(X)\n        X_sorted = X[sorted_indices]\n        y_sorted = y[sorted_indices]\n        \n        # Iterate through possible split points (between adjacent points)\n        for i in range(1, len(X_sorted)):\n            if X_sorted[i] == X_sorted[i-1]:\n                continue  # no split possible between same values\n            \n            threshold = (X_sorted[i-1] + X_sorted[i]) / 2\n            left_indices = sorted_indices[:i]\n            right_indices = sorted_indices[i:]\n            \n            y_left = y[left_indices]\n            y_right = y[right_indices]\n            \n            # Calculate SSE for this split\n            sse_left = np.sum((y_left - np.mean(y_left))**2)\n            sse_right = np.sum((y_right - np.mean(y_right))**2)\n            total_sse = sse_left + sse_right\n            \n            if total_sse < best_sse:\n                best_sse = total_sse\n                best_threshold = threshold\n                best_left_indices = left_indices\n                best_right_indices = right_indices\n        \n        if best_threshold is None:\n            node.value = np.mean(y)\n            return node\n        \n        node.threshold = best_threshold\n        node.left = build_tree(X[best_left_indices], y[best_left_indices], depth + 1)\n        node.right = build_tree(X[best_right_indices], y[best_right_indices], depth + 1)\n        \n        return node\n    \n    root = build_tree(X_train, y_train, 0)\n    \n    def predict_single(x, node):\n        if node.value is not None:\n            return node.value\n        if x <= node.threshold:\n            return predict_single(x, node.left)\n        else:\n            return predict_single(x, node.right)\n    \n    predictions = [predict_single(x, root) for x in X_test]\n    return predictions\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tree Node Structure**: The `TreeNode` class represents each node in the tree. Each node can either be a decision node (with a threshold, left, and right children) or a leaf node (with a value representing the mean of targets in that node).\n2. **Building the Tree**: The `build_tree` function recursively constructs the tree. For each node, it checks if stopping conditions (max depth or fewer than two samples) are met. If not, it evaluates all possible split points in the feature space to find the one that minimizes the SSE. The data is split into left and right subsets based on the best threshold, and the function recurses for each subset.\n3. **Prediction**: The `predict_single` function traverses the tree for each test point, moving left if the feature value is less than or equal to the node's threshold, and right otherwise, until it reaches a leaf node, whose value is returned as the prediction.\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: If the training data is empty, the function returns an empty list. Otherwise, it processes the data to build the tree and generate predictions for each test point.\n\nThis approach efficiently builds a regression tree by recursively splitting the data to minimize SSE, ensuring optimal predictions while adhering to the constraints provided."}

This approach leverages NumPy's efficient vectorized operations for performance and clarity.\n4. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to four decimal places using Python's built-in `round` function to meet the output specification.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the requirements, ensuring correctness for valid inputs and proper error handling for invalid cases.

The conditional_tree_input should be built by traversing the header table's linked list and collecting paths. Each path is the items from the node up to the root (excluding the root), and the count is the node's count. Then, the conditional FP-tree is built from these paths.\n\nBut in the initial code, the mine_tree function is supposed to recursively process each item in the header table, build the conditional pattern base, construct the conditional FP-tree, and then recursively mine it.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\n1. For each item in the header table (processed in sorted order), collect all paths ending with that item (the prefix paths), then build a conditional FP-tree from those paths. If the conditional FP-tree is not empty, recursively mine it.\n\n2. The conditional FP-tree is built by first counting the items in the prefix paths, filtering those that meet the min_sup, then building the tree with the remaining items.\n\n3. The patterns found are the current item combined with each pattern found in the conditional FP-tree.\n\nBut the initial code may have issues with the way the conditional_tree_input is built. For example, the path should be the items from the parent up to the root (excluding the root), and the count should be the node's count.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\n- For each node in the header table's linked list, trace back to the root to get the path (excluding the node's item and the root), and use the node's count for that path.\n\nThen, the conditional FP-tree is built from these paths and their counts.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\n1. For each item in the header table, collect all paths (without the item) and their counts.\n\n2. Build a conditional FP-tree from these paths.\n\n3. If the conditional FP-tree has a header table, recursively mine it.\n\n4. The patterns found are the item combined with each pattern from the conditional FP-tree.\n\nSo, the mine_tree function should:\n\n- For each item in the header table (sorted in ascending order):\n\n   a. The new pattern is the item added to the current prefix.\n\n   b. Collect all paths ending with the item (i.e., for each node in the item's linked list, the path from the parent to the root, and the node's count).\n\n   c. Build a conditional FP-tree from these paths.\n\n   d. If the conditional FP-tree has items, recursively mine it, appending the item to the current prefix.\n\n   e. Add all patterns found to the results.\n\nSo, the code should work like this.\n\nBut in the initial code, the construct_fptree_from_paths function is used to build the conditional FP-tree from the paths and their counts. This function:\n\n- Counts the items in the paths (summing their counts).\n\n- Filters items that meet min_sup.\n\n- Sorts the remaining items in descending order of frequency.\n\n- Builds the FP-tree by inserting each path (filtered and sorted) with their counts.\n\nSo, the initial code should work correctly.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that the initial code doesn't handle the case where the conditional FP-tree is a single path. In such cases, all combinations of items in the path should be generated, combined with the current prefix.\n\nBut the initial code doesn't explicitly check for single-path conditional FP-trees. Instead, it recursively mines the tree, which would eventually handle single paths by processing each item in the header table.\n\nBut the FP-growth algorithm can optimize by generating all combinations when the conditional FP-tree is a single path. However, the initial code doesn't include this optimization, but it should still produce the correct results, albeit potentially less efficiently.\n\nSo, the initial code should work correctly.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is with the way the paths are collected in the mine_tree function. For example, when collecting the paths for the conditional pattern base, the code should:\n\n- For each node in the item's linked list:\n\n   a. Trace back to the root to collect the items in the path (excluding the node's item and the root).\n\n   b. The count for this path is the node's count.\n\nSo, the path is the items from the parent up to the root (excluding the root), and the count is the node's count.\n\nSo, the initial code seems to do this correctly.\n\nThus, the initial code should work.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is with the way the frequent_items is passed around. In the initial code, the frequent_items from the initial FP-tree is passed to the mine_tree function, but it's not used in the conditional FP-tree construction. Instead, the conditional FP-tree construction uses the counts from the conditional pattern base.\n\nSo, the initial code should work.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is with the way the patterns are collected. The mine_tree function appends the new pattern (current prefix + item) to the patterns list, and then extends it with the patterns found in the conditional FP-tree.\n\nSo, the patterns are built correctly.\n\nThus, the initial code should work.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is with the way the transactions are processed. The initial code converts the transactions to a list of lists, which should be fine.\n\nSo, the initial code should work.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is with the way the header table is built. The initial code builds the header table as a defaultdict where each entry is the first node in the linked list. The mine_tree function processes the header table's keys in sorted order, which is correct.\n\nSo, the initial code should work.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is with the way the patterns are sorted. The initial code sorts the patterns first by length and then lexicographically, which is correct.\n\nSo, the initial code should work.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is with the way the conditional FP-tree is built.

{"task_id": 492, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to generate a polynomial feature matrix up to a given degree from an input data matrix. The solution involves creating all possible monomials of the original features where the total degree of each monomial does not exceed the specified degree. The monomials should be ordered first by ascending total degree and then lexicographically within each degree.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the degree is negative, return -1 immediately.\n2. **Convert Input to NumPy Array**: This allows for easier manipulation of the data.\n3. **Generate Feature Combinations**: For each degree from 0 up to the specified degree, generate all possible combinations of features (with replacement) that sum up to the current degree. This can be efficiently done using `itertools.combinations_with_replacement` for each degree.\n4. **Compute Monomials**: For each combination of features (indices) generated, compute the product of the corresponding features raised to the powers determined by the combination. For example, for a combination (0, 1, 1) (indicating features 0, 1, and 1), the monomial would be \\(x_0^1 \\cdot x_1^2\\) (since feature 1 appears twice).\n5. **Construct Result Matrix**: For each sample in the input data, compute all the monomials in the specified order and construct the resulting matrix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement, product\n\ndef polynomial_features(X: list[list[int | float]], degree: int) -> list[list[float]]:\n    \"\"\"Generate a full polynomial feature matrix up to a given degree.\"\"\"\n    if degree < 0:\n        return -1\n    \n    X_array = np.array(X, dtype=float)\n    n_samples, n_features = X_array.shape\n    features = []\n    \n    for d in range(degree + 1):\n        # Generate all possible combinations of feature indices with replacement that sum to degree d\n        for indices in combinations_with_replacement(range(n_features), d):\n            # Create a tuple of exponents for each feature\n            exponents = np.zeros(n_features, dtype=int)\n            for idx in indices:\n                exponents[idx] += 1\n            features.append(exponents)\n    \n    # Now, for each sample, compute the product of features^exponents for each exponents tuple\n    result = []\n    for sample in X_array:\n        row = []\n        for exp in features:\n            term = 1.0\n            for f in range(n_features):\n                term *= sample[f] ** exp[f]\n            row.append(term)\n        result.append(row)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Edge Handling**: The function first checks if the degree is negative and returns -1 if so.\n2. **Data Conversion**: The input list of lists is converted into a NumPy array for easier manipulation.\n3. **Generating Exponents**: For each degree from 0 to the specified degree, the function generates all possible combinations of feature indices (with replacement) that sum up to the current degree.

If not, it returns -1, adhering to the specification.\n2. **Conversion to NumPy Array**: The input `x` is converted into a NumPy array to facilitate uniform processing, whether the input is a nested list or already an array.\n3. **Exponential Calculation**: The exponential function \\( e^x \\) is computed for each element in the array. This works for all valid orders (0, 1, 2) because the derivatives of \\( e^x \\) are identical to the original function.\n4. **Rounding and Conversion**: The results are rounded to six decimal places using NumPy's `round` function. The rounded array is then converted back to a Python list with the same structure as the input using `tolist()`, ensuring the output format matches the input format.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the computation while maintaining the required output structure and precision, providing a robust solution for the given problem."}

This involves calculating the sigmoid activation of the hidden units using the current weights and biases.\n3. **Gibbs Sampling (CD-k)**: Perform `k` steps of Gibbs sampling. Each step alternates between sampling hidden units given visible units and sampling visible units given hidden units. However, instead of stochastic sampling, we use the probabilities directly (no binary sampling).\n4. **Negative Phase**: After `k` steps, compute the visible and hidden unit probabilities (the negative phase).\n5. **Gradient Calculation**: Compute the positive gradient as the outer product of the visible data and the initial hidden probabilities, and the negative gradient as the outer product of the visible probabilities after `k` steps and the hidden probabilities after `k` steps.\n6. **Weight Update**: Update the weights using the difference between the positive and negative gradients, scaled by the learning rate and divided by the batch size.\n7. **Rounding and Conversion**: Round the updated weights to four decimal places and convert the NumPy array to a list of lists.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef contrastive_divergence(\n        X: np.ndarray,\n        W: np.ndarray,\n        hbias: np.ndarray,\n        vbias: np.ndarray,\n        learning_rate: float,\n        k: int) -> list[list[float]]:\n    \"\"\"Perform one CD-k weight update for a binary RBM.\n\n    Args:\n        X: A 2-D NumPy array of shape (batch_size, n_visible) containing the\n           mini-batch of visible units.

This alternation is done `k` times without stochastic sampling.\n4. **Gradient Calculation**: The positive gradient is the matrix product of the transpose of the visible data `X` and the initial hidden probabilities `h0_prob`. The negative gradient is the matrix product of the transpose of the visible probabilities after `k` steps (`v_k_prob`) and the hidden probabilities after `k` steps (`h_k_prob`).\n5. **Weight Update**: The weights are updated by adding the scaled difference between the positive and negative gradients (scaled by the learning rate and divided by the batch size `m`).\n6. **Rounding and Conversion**: The updated weights are rounded to four decimal places and converted from a NumPy array to a list of lists for the final output.\n\nThis approach efficiently implements the CD-k algorithm for training an RBM, leveraging matrix operations for clarity and performance."}

The formula for binary cross-entropy for a single element is: \\( -[y \\cdot \\log(\\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \\cdot \\log(1 - \\hat{y})] \\).\n   - To ensure numerical stability, clip the predicted values \\(\\hat{y}\\) (y_pred) to a small interval around 0 and 1 (e.g., using `np.finfo(float).eps` to avoid log(0)).\n\n2. **KL Divergence**:\n   - The KL divergence between the approximate posterior \\( q(t|x) \\) (a Gaussian with mean \\(\\mu\\) and log-variance \\(\\log \\sigma^2\\)) and the prior \\( p(t) \\) (a unit Gaussian) is given by:\n     \\[ \\text{KL} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum (1 + \\log \\sigma^2 - \\mu^2 - \\sigma^2) \\]\n   - Here, \\(\\sigma^2\\) can be obtained by exponentiating `t_log_var`.\n\n3. **Total Loss**:\n   - Sum the reconstruction loss and KL divergence for each sample in the mini-batch, then average over the batch size.\n   - Round the result to six decimal places before returning.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef vae_loss(y: np.ndarray,\n             y_pred: np.ndarray,\n             t_mean: np.ndarray,\n             t_log_var: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Compute the VAE loss for Bernoulli visible units.\n\n    The function must return the mini-batch average of binary cross-entropy\n    plus KL divergence, rounded to 6 decimal places.\n\n    Args:\n        y (np.ndarray): Ground-truth binary data of shape (batch_size, n_features).\n        y_pred (np.ndarray): Reconstructed probabilities with the same shape as *y*.\n        t_mean (np.ndarray): Mean of q(t|x) of shape (batch_size, latent_dim).\n        t_log_var (np.ndarray): Log-variance of q(t|x), same shape as *t_mean*.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: Average VAE loss rounded to 6 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    epsilon = np.finfo(float).eps\n    y_pred_clipped = np.clip(y_pred, epsilon, 1.0 - epsilon)\n    \n    # Compute binary cross-entropy (reconstruction loss)\n    reconstruction_loss = -np.mean(np.sum(y * np.log(y_pred_clipped) + (1 - y) * np.log(1 - y_pred_clipped), axis=1)\n    \n    # Compute KL divergence\n    kl_divergence = -0.5 * np.sum(1 + t_log_var - np.square(t_mean) - np.exp(t_log_var), axis=1)\n    \n    # Average over the batch\n    total_loss = np.mean(reconstruction_loss + kl_divergence)\n    \n    return round(total_loss, 6)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Clipping y_pred**: The predicted values are clipped to avoid numerical instability when taking the logarithm.

If either `k_h` exceeds `h` or `k_w` exceeds `w`, the configuration is invalid, and the function returns -1.\n3. **Exact Division Check**: The differences `(h - k_h)` and `(w - k_w)` must be exactly divisible by their respective strides. If either division leaves a remainder, the output dimensions would not be integers, making the configuration invalid, hence returning -1.\n4. **Output Calculation**: If all checks pass, the output dimensions are computed using integer division (to ensure results are integers) and returned as a tuple. This ensures the pooling operation can be performed without padding and results in valid spatial dimensions.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for valid configurations and computes the output dimensions only when all conditions are met, ensuring correctness and robustness."}

If not, return -1 immediately.\n2. **Convert to NumPy Arrays**: Convert both input vectors into one-dimensional NumPy arrays. This ensures uniformity in handling whether the inputs are lists or arrays.\n3. **Compute Euclidean Distance**: The Euclidean distance between two vectors \\( \\mathbf{a} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{b} \\) is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between corresponding elements of the vectors.

The first step is to convert the input into a NumPy array to facilitate uniform processing.\n2. **Numerically Stable Sigmoid Calculation**: The sigmoid function \\( g(z) = 1 / (1 + e^{-z}) \\) can lead to numerical overflow for large negative or positive values of \\( z \\). To avoid this:\n   - For large positive \\( z \\), \\( e^{-z} \\) becomes very small, so \\( g(z) \\) approaches 1. We can compute it as \\( 1 / (1 + e^{-z}) \\) when \\( z \\geq 0 \\).\n   - For large negative \\( z \\), \\( e^{-z} \\) becomes very large, leading to potential overflow. Instead, compute \\( g(z) \\) as \\( e^{z} / (1 + e^{z}) \\) when \\( z < 0 \\).\n3. **Element-wise Computation**: Use NumPy's vectorized operations to apply the sigmoid function element-wise to the input array.\n4. **Rounding and Output Structure**: Round the results to four decimal places.

The function should handle various input types, including scalars, lists, nested lists, and NumPy arrays, and return the result in the same structure as the input, with each value rounded to four decimal places.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Input Type**: The function needs to handle different input types (scalar, list, nested list, or NumPy array) and process each element accordingly.\n2. **Recursive Processing for Nested Lists**: For nested lists, we will use a recursive approach to traverse each element, compute the gradient for each scalar value, and reconstruct the nested structure in the output.\n3. **NumPy Array Handling**: If the input is a NumPy array, we will compute the gradient element-wise, round the results to four decimal places, and convert the result back to a nested list if the original input was a list.

However, the task description says: \"return a Python object of the same rank: for a scalar input return a float, otherwise return a (nested) list with the same shape as the input.\"\n\nSo, if the input is a NumPy array, the output should be a nested list. So we need to modify the code to convert the NumPy array to a nested list after processing.\n\nSo, the corrected approach for NumPy arrays would be to compute the gradient, round it, and then convert it to a nested list using the .tolist() method.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sigmoid_grad(z):\n    \"\"\"Return the derivative of the sigmoid function given its output.\n\n    The input *z* already contains sigmoid values (numbers in [0,1]).

The solution should handle various input types, including scalars, nested lists, and NumPy ndarrays, and return the result in the specified format.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Input Type**: Determine if the input is a scalar (Python int, float, or a 0-dimensional NumPy array). If it is, compute the gradient directly by checking if the value is greater than 0.\n2. **Handle Non-scalar Inputs**: For non-scalar inputs (lists or NumPy arrays), convert the input into a NumPy array if it isn't already one. This allows us to use NumPy's vectorized operations to efficiently compute the gradient element-wise.\n3. **Compute Gradient**: Using NumPy's `where` function or boolean indexing, replace all elements greater than 0 with 1 and others with 0.\n4. **Convert Result to Appropriate Format**: If the input was a scalar, return an integer (0 or 1).

If it is, the function returns 1 if `z` is greater than 0, otherwise 0.\n2. **Non-scalar Handling**: For non-scalar inputs, the function checks if the input is a list and converts it into a NumPy array. This allows the use of NumPy's efficient operations. The gradient is computed by checking which elements of the array are greater than 0, converting the resulting boolean array to integers (True becomes 1, False becomes 0).\n3. **Result Conversion**: The resulting NumPy array is converted back to a nested list structure using the `tolist()` method to ensure the output format matches the input shape exactly, adhering to the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles different input types and ensures the output is in the correct format, whether it's a simple scalar or a complex nested structure."}

The shape of the tensor is specified by the `weight_shape` argument.\n3. **Round the Values**: Round each element in the generated tensor to 4 decimal places using NumPy's `round` function.\n4. **Convert to Python List**: Convert the resulting NumPy array to a pure Python nested list using the `tolist` method.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef standard_normal(weight_shape):\n    \"\"\"Return a tensor of the given shape filled with samples from N(0,1).\n\n    The function *must* reset the NumPy random seed to 42 every time it is\n    called so that the output is reproducible.

This ensures that every time the function is called, the same sequence of random numbers is generated, making the output reproducible.\n2. **Handling Shape Argument**: The `weight_shape` argument can be an integer, a tuple, or a list. The code checks if it's an integer and converts it into a tuple with a single element. Otherwise, it converts the list or tuple into a tuple to use as the shape for the tensor.\n3. **Generating Random Numbers**: The function then generates random numbers from the standard normal distribution using `np.random.randn(*shape)`, where `shape` is the unpacked tuple specifying the dimensions of the tensor.\n4. **Rounding Values**: Each element in the generated tensor is rounded to 4 decimal places using `np.round(tensor, 4)`.\n5. **Conversion to Python List**: Finally, the rounded NumPy array is converted to a pure Python nested list using the `tolist()` method and returned.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function meets all the specified requirements, including reproducibility, correct rounding, and returning the result as a Python list."}
{"task_id": 523, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the He normal initialization for neural network weights. The He normal distribution is a normal distribution with mean 0 and a standard deviation derived from the fan-in of the weight tensor. The fan-in depends on the shape of the weight tensor, which can be either a 2-D matrix (for dense layers) or a 4-D tensor (for convolutional layers). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Determine the fan-in**: \n   - For a 2-D tensor (shape `(n_in, n_out)`), the fan-in is `n_in`.\n   - For a 4-D tensor (shape `(kernel_h, kernel_w, in_channels, out_channels)`), the fan-in is `kernel_h * kernel_w * in_channels`.\n   - For any other shape, treat it as a 2-D tensor and use the first dimension as the fan-in.\n2. **Calculate the standard deviation**: The standard deviation \u03c3 is given by \u03c3 = \u221a(2 / fan_in).\n3. **Generate random weights**: Using NumPy's random number generator, draw samples from a normal distribution with mean 0 and the calculated standard deviation.\n4. **Convert to nested lists and round values**: Convert the NumPy array to a nested Python list structure and round each element to four decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef he_normal(weight_shape: tuple[int, ...]) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Initialise a weight tensor using the He normal distribution.\n\n    Args:\n        weight_shape: Shape of the desired weight tensor.

For a 4-D shape (convolutional layer), it calculates the fan-in as the product of the kernel height, kernel width, and input channels. For a 2-D shape (dense layer), it uses the first dimension. For any other shape, it defaults to using the first dimension as the fan-in.\n2. **Standard Deviation Calculation**: The standard deviation for the He normal distribution is computed as the square root of 2 divided by the fan-in.\n3. **Random Weight Generation**: Using NumPy's `random.normal` function, the function generates random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and the computed standard deviation, shaped according to the input dimensions.\n4. **Conversion and Rounding**: The generated NumPy array is converted into a nested list structure, with each element rounded to four decimal places. This is handled recursively to accommodate any tensor rank (2-D or higher).\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both dense and convolutional layers, providing appropriately initialized weights that can help in faster convergence during neural network training."}
{"task_id": 525, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement Ridge Regression using the closed-form solution. The approach involves mean-centering the data, solving for the optimal weights using regularization, and then recovering the bias term. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mean-centering the Data**: \n   - Compute the mean of each feature column in the design matrix \\( X \\) and subtract these means from each respective column. This centers the features around zero.\n   - Similarly, compute the mean of the target vector \\( y \\) and subtract this mean from each element in \\( y \\). This centers the target values around zero.\n\n2. **Solving for Optimal Weights**:\n   - The optimal weights \\( w \\) are found using the formula \\( w = (X^T X + \\lambda I)^{-1} X^T y \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) is the regularization parameter and \\( I \\) is the identity matrix. \n   - If the matrix \\( X^T X + \\lambda I \\) is singular (i.e., not invertible), we use the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse instead, which always exists.\n\n3. **Recovering the Bias**:\n   - The bias term \\( b \\) is computed as \\( b = \\bar{y} - \\bar{x} \\cdot w \\), where \\( \\bar{x} \\) is the vector of feature means and \\( \\bar{y} \\) is the mean of the target values.\n\n4. **Rounding the Results**:\n   - Both the weights and the bias are rounded to four decimal places before returning them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef ridge_regression(\n        X: np.ndarray,\n        y: np.ndarray,\n        lambda_: float = 0.0) -> tuple[list[float], float]:\n    \"\"\"Fit a Ridge (L2-regularised) linear regression model.\n\n    The function must compute the optimal weights **analytically** (closed form)\n    and return them together with the intercept term, both rounded to 4\n    decimal places.\n\n    Args:\n        X: 2-D array of shape (m, n) with the input features.\n        y: 1-D or 2-D array of shape (m,) or (m, 1) with the targets.\n        lambda_: Non-negative regularisation strength.\n\n    Returns:\n        (weights, bias)\n        weights \u2013 list of length *n* with the model weights.\n        bias    \u2013 scalar intercept term.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure y is a 1-D array\n    y = y.flatten()\n    \n    # Compute means\n    x_mean = np.mean(X, axis=0)\n    y_mean = np.mean(y)\n    \n    # Center the data\n    X_centered = X - x_mean\n    y_centered = y - y_mean\n    \n    # Get dimensions\n    m, n = X.shape\n    \n    # Compute the optimal weights\n    XtX = np.dot(X_centered.T, X_centered)\n    lambda_I = lambda_ * np.eye(n)\n    matrix = XtX + lambda_I\n    \n    try:\n        inv_matrix = np.linalg.inv(matrix)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        # Use pseudo-inverse if matrix is singular\n        inv_matrix = np.linalg.pinv(matrix)\n    \n    w = np.dot(inv_matrix, np.dot(X_centered.T, y_centered))\n    \n    # Recover the bias\n    b = y_mean - np.dot(x_mean, w)\n    \n    # Round to 4 decimal places\n    weights = [round(val, 4) for val in w]\n    bias = round(b, 4)\n    \n    return (weights, bias)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mean-centering**: The features \\( X \\) and target \\( y \\) are centered by subtracting their respective means. This step ensures that the bias term is handled separately from the weights, which simplifies the regularization process.\n2. **Regularized Weight Calculation**: The weights are computed using the regularized normal equation \\( (X^T X + \\lambda I)^{-1} X^T y \\). The regularization term \\( \\lambda I \\) ensures the matrix is invertible even if \\( X^T X \\) is singular. If inversion fails, the pseudo-inverse is used as a fallback.\n3. **Bias Recovery**: The bias term is derived from the original means of the features and target, adjusted by the computed weights.\n4. **Rounding**: The weights and bias are rounded to four decimal places to meet the output constraints, ensuring precision and readability.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the Ridge Regression solution in closed form, handling potential singularities and ensuring accurate results through proper mean-centering and regularization."}

These values define the grid's boundaries.\n2. **Grid Generation**: Using `np.linspace`, we create two 1-D arrays (`x1_plot` and `x2_plot`) that evenly span the range of each dimension with `grid_n` points.\n3. **Mesh Grid Creation**: The `np.meshgrid` function generates two 2-D arrays where each point in the grid is represented by combinations of values from `x1_plot` and `x2_plot`.\n4. **Classification**: For each point in the mesh grid, the linear combination of the weights and bias is computed. The `np.where` function is used to assign labels (1 or -1) based on whether the combination is non-negative.\n5. **Result Conversion**: The resulting NumPy array of labels is converted to a nested Python list of lists to meet the output constraints, ensuring compatibility with non-NumPy contexts.\n\nThis approach efficiently generates the decision boundary grid by leveraging NumPy for numerical operations and mesh grid creation, then converting the results into the required Python list format."}

{"task_id": 530, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss function, which is commonly used in binary classification tasks. The BCE loss measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual binary labels. The solution involves clipping the predicted probabilities to avoid numerical instability, computing the loss for each sample, and then averaging the loss over all samples.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Clip the predicted probabilities**: To ensure numerical stability, we clip the values of `y_pred` to the range [1e-7, 1 - 1e-7]. This prevents taking the logarithm of zero or one, which would result in infinite values.\n2. **Compute the BCE loss for each sample**: For each pair of true label (y) and predicted probability (p), the loss is calculated using the formula: \n   \\[\n   \\ell = -[y \\cdot \\log(p) + (1 - y) \\cdot \\log(1 - p)]\n   \\]\n3. **Average the loss over all samples**: The mean of all individual losses is computed to get the average loss over the batch.\n4. **Round the result**: The final result is rounded to four decimal places for consistency and readability.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef binary_cross_entropy(y_true: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Calculates the mean Binary Cross-Entropy loss.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    y_true : np.ndarray\n        Ground-truth binary labels (0 or 1).\n    y_pred : np.ndarray\n        Predicted probabilities for the positive class.

This step is crucial to avoid numerical issues when computing logarithms, as log(0) is undefined and log(1) is zero, which could lead to infinite or unstable loss values.\n2. **Loss Calculation**: For each sample, the BCE loss is computed using the formula provided. The formula effectively penalizes the model more when the predicted probability diverges from the actual label. For instance, if the true label is 1 and the predicted probability is close to 0, the loss will be high due to the logarithm term.\n3. **Averaging the Loss**: The individual losses for all samples in the batch are averaged to get the mean loss, which provides a single scalar value representing the overall performance of the model on the batch.\n4. **Rounding the Result**: The final mean loss is rounded to four decimal places to meet the specified output constraints, ensuring consistency and readability.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the BCE loss while handling numerical stability, making it suitable for training binary classifiers or GAN discriminators."}

The key difference between the symmetric and periodic windows lies in how the phase variable \u03b8\u2099 is sampled. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Determine the Sampling Points for \u03b8\u2099**:\n   - For a **symmetric window**, sample exactly `window_len` points uniformly spaced between -\u03c0 and \u03c0. This is straightforward using NumPy's `linspace` function.\n   - For a **periodic window**, sample `window_len + 1` points uniformly spaced between -\u03c0 and \u03c0, then discard the last point. This results in `window_len` points, which is necessary for periodic windows used in FFTs to avoid redundancy at the endpoints.\n\n2. **Compute the Window Values**:\n   - For each sample point \u03b8\u2099, compute the sum of cosine terms weighted by the given coefficients. The cosine terms are cos(k\u03b8\u2099) for each coefficient a\u2096, where k ranges from 0 to K (the number of coefficients minus one).\n\n3. **Round the Results**:\n   - Round each computed window value to four decimal places before returning them as a list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef generalized_cosine(window_len: int, coefs: list[float], symmetric: bool = False) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Generate a generalized cosine window.\n\n    The function should create either a periodic or a symmetric generalized\n    cosine window according to the *symmetric* flag and return it rounded to\n    four decimal places.\n\n    Args:\n        window_len (int): Desired length *L* of the final window (must be\n            strictly positive).\n        coefs (list[float]): List of coefficients ``a_k``.\n        symmetric (bool, optional): If *True* produce a symmetric window of\n            length *L*; otherwise produce a periodic window suitable for the\n            FFT.

This creates a symmetric window suitable for FIR filter design.\n   - If `symmetric` is `False`, the function generates `window_len + 1` points and discards the last one, resulting in `window_len` points. This approach is used for periodic windows in FFT applications to ensure proper periodicity.\n\n2. **Computing the Window Values**:\n   - The window values are computed by summing the contributions of each cosine term, weighted by the corresponding coefficient. For each coefficient `a_k` at index `k`, the term `a_k * cos(k\u03b8\u2099)` is added to the window values for each \u03b8\u2099.\n\n3. **Rounding and Returning**:\n   - The computed window values are rounded to four decimal places using NumPy's `round` function and converted to a Python list before returning. This meets the output constraints specified.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both symmetric and periodic window generation by adjusting the sampling of \u03b8\u2099 and leverages vectorized operations for performance and clarity."}

The depth at this node is simply the current depth.\n3. **Recursive Traversal**: For non-leaf nodes, recursively traverse both the left and right subtrees. The leaf count for the current node is the sum of the leaf counts from both subtrees. The max depth is the maximum of the depths from both subtrees plus one (to account for the current node).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef tree_stats(root: \"node | None\") -> tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\"Return the number of leaf nodes and the maximum depth of the tree.\n\n    A **leaf** is defined as a node whose ``results`` attribute is not ``None``.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    root : node | None\n        Root of the decision tree.

If so, it returns (0, 0), indicating no leaves and zero depth.\n- **Leaf Node Check**: If the current node's `results` is not `None`, it is a leaf node, so the function returns (1, 1), indicating one leaf and a depth of 1.\n- **Recursive Traversal**: For non-leaf nodes, the function recursively processes the left and right children. The total leaf count is the sum of leaves from both subtrees. The maximum depth is the greater of the depths from the left and right subtrees, incremented by 1 to include the current node.\n- **Initial Check**: The main function first checks if the root is `None` (empty tree) and returns (0, 0) immediately in that case. Otherwise, it delegates the computation to the helper function starting from the root.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes both statistics in a single pass through the tree using recursion, ensuring optimal performance and correctness."}

If the current node's Gini impurity is zero (all samples belong to the same class), create a leaf node with that class label.\n2. **Gini Impurity Calculation**: Compute the Gini impurity for the current dataset.

This serves as a baseline to compare potential splits against.\n2. **Iterate Over All Features and Unique Values**: For each feature in the dataset, consider each unique value in that feature's column as a potential split value.\n3. **Evaluate Each Split**: For each split value, partition the dataset into left (samples where the feature equals the split value) and right (remaining samples) subsets. Compute the weighted Gini impurity for this split.\n4. **Track Best Split**: Keep track of the split that yields the lowest weighted Gini impurity. If the best split's impurity is not at least epsilon less than the parent's impurity, return the default tuple.\n5. **Handle Edge Cases**: If there are no valid splits (e.g., all samples have the same value for a feature), ensure the function handles these cases gracefully.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef best_gini_split(X: np.ndarray,\n                    y: np.ndarray,\n                    epsilon: float = 1e-3) -> tuple[int, object, float]:\n    \"\"\"Find the best (feature, value) equality split based on Gini impurity.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X : np.ndarray\n        2-D array with shape (n_samples, n_features) containing the feature\n        values.

For each value, it splits the dataset into left (samples where the feature equals the value) and right (remaining samples) subsets.\n3. **Gini Calculation for Splits**: The Gini impurity for each subset is calculated similarly to the parent node. The weighted average of these impurities gives the split's overall Gini score.\n4. **Best Split Tracking**: The algorithm keeps track of the split with the lowest Gini score. If this score is at least epsilon better than the parent's Gini, the split is returned; otherwise, the function returns the default tuple indicating no valid split was found.\n\nThis approach efficiently evaluates all possible splits, ensuring optimal performance while adhering to the constraints of using only NumPy and Python's standard library."}

The algorithm then decides whether to explore the left or right subtree based on the splitting axis and the query point's value, potentially pruning parts of the tree that cannot contain closer points.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport heapq\n\ndef k_nearest_neighbors(points: list[list[float]], query: list[float], k: int = 3) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Find the *k* nearest neighbours of *query* among *points* using a k-d tree.\"\"\"\n    if not points:\n        return []\n    \n    n = len(points)\n    k = min(k, n)\n    \n    # Build the k-d tree\n    def build_kd_tree(indices, depth=0):\n        if not indices:\n            return None\n        axis = depth % len(query)  # Determine the splitting axis\n        # Sort indices based on the current axis and select median\n        indices_sorted = sorted(indices, key=lambda i: points[i][axis])\n        median_pos = len(indices_sorted) // 2\n        median_idx = indices_sorted[median_pos]\n        # Create the node\n        node = {\n            'index': median_idx,\n            'axis': axis,\n            'left': build_kd_tree(indices_sorted[:median_pos], depth + 1),\n            'right': build_kd_tree(indices_sorted[median_pos + 1:], depth + 1)\n        }\n        return node\n    \n    root = build_kd_tree(list(range(len(points))))\n    \n    # Perform k-NN search\n    max_heap = []\n    \n    def squared_distance(p1, p2):\n        return sum((a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(p1, p2))\n    \n    def search(node, depth=0):\n        if node is None:\n            return\n        point_idx = node['index']\n        point = points[point_idx]\n        dist_sq = squared_distance(point, query)\n        axis = node['axis']\n        \n        # Push to heap (using negative distance to simulate max heap)\n        if len(max_heap) < k:\n            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-dist_sq, point_idx))\n        else:\n            if dist_sq < -max_heap[0][0]:\n                heapq.heappop(max_heap)\n                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-dist_sq, point_idx))\n            elif dist_sq == -max_heap[0][0] and point_idx < max_heap[0][1]:\n                heapq.heappop(max_heap)\n                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-dist_sq, point_idx))\n        \n        # Decide which side to visit first\n        diff = query[axis] - point[axis]\n        if diff <= 0:\n            search(node['left'], depth + 1)\n            if diff ** 2 < -max_heap[0][0] or len(max_heap) < k:\n                search(node['right'], depth + 1)\n        else:\n            search(node['right'], depth + 1)\n            if diff ** 2 < -max_heap[0][0] or len(max_heap) < k:\n                search(node['left'], depth + 1)\n    \n    search(root)\n    \n    # Extract results, sorted by distance and then index\n    results = []\n    while max_heap:\n        dist_sq, idx = heapq.heappop(max_heap)\n        results.append((-dist_sq, idx))\n    results.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    sorted_indices = [idx for (dist_sq, idx) in results]\n    \n    return sorted_indices[:k]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Building the k-d Tree**:\n   - The `build_kd_tree` function recursively constructs the tree by selecting the median point along the current axis (alternating between dimensions) for each subtree. This ensures the tree is balanced, optimizing search operations.\n   \n2. **Nearest Neighbor Search**:\n   - The `search` function traverses the tree, using a max-heap to keep track of the k nearest neighbors. For each node, it checks if the current point is closer than the farthest point in the heap. The search prioritizes the subtree that is more likely to contain closer points based on the query's position relative to the splitting plane, pruning unnecessary branches when possible.\n   \n3. **Result Extraction**:\n   - After the search, the results are extracted from the heap, sorted by distance (and index for ties), and the top k indices are returned. This ensures the output meets the specified constraints of being sorted by ascending distance and index.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the search space using the k-d tree properties, significantly reducing the number of distance calculations compared to a brute-force search."}

For each sample, compute the decision function using the current alphas and bias. If the sample is misclassified, update the corresponding alpha and the bias.\n4. **Convergence Check**: The loop stops if no updates are made during a complete pass over the training data or if the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n5. **Weight Vector Recovery**: After training, compute the weight vector (w) as the sum of the product of each alpha, its corresponding label, and its feature vector.\n6. **Rounding**: Round each component of the weight vector and the bias term to four decimal places before returning them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef perceptron_dual_train(X_data: np.ndarray,\n                          y_data: np.ndarray,\n                          eta: float = 1.0,\n                          max_iter: int = 1000) -> tuple[list[float], float]:\n    \"\"\"Train a binary (\u00b11) perceptron using the dual formulation.\n\n    Args:\n        X_data: 2-D NumPy array containing N samples (shape = N \u00d7 d).\n        y_data: 1-D NumPy array of length N with labels \u22121 or 1.\n        eta:    Learning rate (default 1.0).\n        max_iter: Maximum number of complete passes over the data.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (w, b) where w is the learned weight vector converted to a\n        Python list (each element rounded to 4 decimals) and b is the rounded\n        bias term.\n    \"\"\"\n    N, d = X_data.shape\n    alpha = np.zeros(N)\n    b = 0.0\n    \n    # Build the Gram matrix\n    G = np.dot(X_data, X_data.T)  # G[i,j] = X[i] .

If multiple features have the same highest gain, the smallest column index is chosen.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef choose_best_feature(X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> tuple[int, float]:\n    \"\"\"Return the feature index that yields maximal information gain.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X : np.ndarray\n        2-D array of shape (n_samples, n_features) containing discrete feature\n        values encoded as non-negative integers starting from 0.\n    y : np.ndarray\n        1-D array of shape (n_samples,) containing integer class labels\n        starting from 0.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple[int, float]\n        A tuple consisting of the index of the best feature and the maximum\n        information gain rounded to 6 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n    \n    def entropy(labels):\n        unique_labels, counts = np.unique(labels, return_counts=True)\n        probabilities = counts / len(labels)\n        return -np.sum(probabilities * np.log2(probabilities))\n    \n    H_y = entropy(y)\n    max_gain = -1\n    best_feature = 0\n    \n    for feature_idx in range(n_features):\n        feature_values = X[:, feature_idx]\n        unique_values = np.unique(feature_values)\n        conditional_entropy = 0.0\n        \n        for value in unique_values:\n            mask = feature_values == value\n            y_subset = y[mask]\n            if len(y_subset) == 0:\n                continue\n            prob = len(y_subset) / n_samples\n            conditional_entropy += prob * entropy(y_subset)\n        \n        information_gain = H_y - conditional_entropy\n        if information_gain > max_gain:\n            max_gain = information_gain\n            best_feature = feature_idx\n        elif math.isclose(information_gain, max_gain, rel_tol=1e-9):\n            if feature_idx < best_feature:\n                best_feature = feature_idx\n    \n    return (best_feature, round(max_gain, 6))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Entropy Calculation**: The `entropy` function computes the entropy of a set of labels. It first counts the occurrences of each unique label, converts these counts into probabilities, and then calculates the entropy using these probabilities.\n2. **Initial Entropy (H(y))**: The entropy of the entire label set `y` is computed once, as it is a common term in all information gain calculations.\n3. **Conditional Entropy (H(y|A))**: For each feature, the dataset is split into subsets where each subset corresponds to a unique value of the feature. The entropy of each subset is calculated and weighted by the subset's proportion of the total dataset. The sum of these weighted entropies gives the conditional entropy for the feature.\n4. **Information Gain Calculation**: The information gain for each feature is the difference between the initial entropy `H(y)` and the conditional entropy `H(y|A)`. The feature with the highest gain is selected, with ties resolved by choosing the smallest index.\n5. **Rounding and Return**: The maximum information gain is rounded to six decimal places, and the best feature index along with this gain is returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the information gain for each feature and selects the optimal one according to the ID3 algorithm's criteria."}

Adjust the path length using a correction factor for small leaf sizes.\n4. **Compute Anomaly Scores**: Using the average path lengths across all trees, compute the anomaly score for each data point. The score is higher for points with shorter average path lengths.\n5. **Identify Outliers**: Sort the anomaly scores and return the indices of the top epsilon fraction of points with the highest scores.

This helps in efficiently accessing the weights during training and prediction.\n2. **Empirical Distribution**: The empirical distribution is computed by counting how often each feature-value-label combination appears in the training data, normalized by the total number of samples.\n3. **GIS Training**: The weights are iteratively updated to minimize the difference between the model's expected feature values and the empirical feature values. The update uses a logarithmic adjustment scaled by a constant \\( C \\), which ensures convergence.\n4. **Prediction**: For each test sample, the conditional probability \\( P(y|x) \\) is computed for each label using the learned weights. The label with the highest probability is chosen as the prediction.\n\nThis approach efficiently learns the feature weights using GIS and applies them to predict labels for new samples, adhering to the principles of maximum entropy."}

Since each document is represented as a tuple `(label, words)`, we ignore the label and focus on the words.\n2. **Track Document Frequencies**: For each word, we need to count in how many distinct documents it appears. This means that even if a word appears multiple times in a single document, it only counts once for that document.\n3. **Calculate Ratios**: The document-frequency ratio for each word is calculated by dividing the number of documents containing the word by the total number of documents. This ratio is then rounded to four decimal places.\n4. **Sort Words by Frequency**: The words are sorted in descending order based on their document-frequency ratios. If two words have the same ratio, their order relative to each other does not matter.\n5. **Handle Cut-off for Set**: The set of top words is determined by the `cut_off` parameter. If `cut_off` is `None`, all words are included. If `cut_off` is larger than the number of distinct words, all words are included. If `cut_off` is zero, an empty set is returned.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom typing import Iterable, Tuple, List, Set, Any\n\n\ndef statistic_key_word(\n    data: List[Tuple[Any, Iterable[str]]],\n    cut_off: int | None = None\n) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[str, float]], Set[str]]:\n    \"\"\"Calculate how often each word appears across documents.\n\n    The function returns a list with the document-frequency ratio of every word\n    (sorted from highest to lowest) and a set containing only the *cut_off*\n    most frequent words.

If it is, we return an empty list and an empty set.\n2. **Tracking Document Frequencies**: We use a `defaultdict` to count how many documents each word appears in. For each document, we convert the words into a set to ensure each word is counted only once per document.\n3. **Calculating Ratios**: For each word, we compute the ratio by dividing the document count by the total number of documents. The result is rounded to four decimal places.\n4. **Sorting Words**: The words are sorted based on their ratios in descending order. If two words have the same ratio, they are sorted alphabetically to ensure consistent ordering, though the problem states that the relative order in such cases does not matter.\n5. **Handling Cut-off**: The set of top words is generated based on the `cut_off` parameter. If `cut_off` is `None`, all words are included. If `cut_off` is zero or negative, an empty set is returned. Otherwise, the top `k` words from the sorted list are included in the set.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the documents, calculates the required statistics, and handles edge cases such as empty input or invalid `cut_off` values. The solution ensures clarity and correctness with appropriate data structures and sorting mechanisms."}

It then loops through each element from the first to the penultimate element (index `0` to `len(corpus) - 2`). In each iteration, it creates a tuple consisting of the current element and the next element (i.e., `(corpus[i], corpus[i+1])`) and appends this tuple to the `pairs` list.\n3. **Result Return**: After processing all consecutive elements, the function returns the `pairs` list, which contains all the consecutive pairs in the order they appear in the original list.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the generation of consecutive pairs while adhering to the constraints and requirements specified.

If true, it returns -1, indicating `a` is smaller.\n- **Equality Handling**: If neither of the previous conditions is met, the function concludes that `a` and `b` are equal (as per the `==` operator) and returns 0.\nThis approach efficiently handles all comparison scenarios for objects that support the standard comparison operators, replicating the exact behavior of Python 2's `cmp` function."}

The query point `x_query` is also normalized using the same scaling factors.\n3. **Nearest Neighbors Selection**: The function computes the distances of all training points to the normalized query point and selects the `window` nearest neighbors.\n4. **Tricubic Weights Calculation**: For each neighbor, the weight is computed using the tricubic function, which gives higher weights to points closer to the query point.\n5. **Weighted Linear Regression**: The function fits a weighted linear regression line. If the denominator for the slope calculation is zero (indicating all `x` values are the same or weights are zero), it defaults to a horizontal line (slope zero) and uses the weighted mean of `y` values.\n6. **Prediction and Denormalization**: The predicted `y` value for the query point is computed in the normalized scale and then converted back to the original scale. The result is rounded to four decimal places before returning.\n\nThis approach ensures that the LOWESS prediction is robust and handles edge cases such as uniform `x` values or zero weights gracefully."}

The maximum of these two values is taken, and then incremented by 1 to account for the current node's depth. This approach effectively traverses each node once, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nFor example, in the case of a single node tree (root with no children), the left and right subtree depths will both be -1 (since they are None). The maximum of -1 and -1 is -1, adding 1 gives 0, which is the correct depth for the root node.

The solution requires careful handling of edge cases, such as cells on the borders or corners of the grid, where some neighbors might not exist.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Determine Neighbors**: For the given cell (row, col), identify all eight possible neighboring cells. This includes cells adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.\n2. **Check Validity of Neighbors**: For each potential neighbor, check if it lies within the bounds of the grid. This is crucial to avoid index errors when accessing the arrays.\n3. **Categorize Neighbors**: For each valid neighbor:\n   - Check if the cell is unopened (i.e., `clicked` is False for that cell). If so, add its coordinates to the list of unopened neighbors.\n   - Check if the cell is flagged (i.e., `flags` is True for that cell). If so, increment the flagged count.\n4. **Sort Unopened Neighbors**: The list of unopened neighbors should be sorted in ascending order first by row, then by column (lexicographic order).\n5. **Return Results**: Return the sorted list of unopened neighbors and the count of flagged neighbors.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_cell(clicked: np.ndarray, flags: np.ndarray, row: int, col: int) -> tuple[list[tuple[int, int]], int]:\n    \"\"\"Return unopened neighbouring cells and flagged-mine count for a board position.\n\n    Args:\n        clicked: 2-D NumPy boolean array where True means the cell is already opened.\n        flags:   2-D NumPy boolean array of the same shape \u2013 True means the cell is\n                  already marked as a mine by the player.\n        row:     Row index of the cell to analyse.\n        col:     Column index of the cell to analyse.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple (unopened_neighbours, flagged_count):\n        * unopened_neighbours \u2013 list with coordinates (row, col) of all neighbouring\n          cells that are not opened yet.

If these coordinates are within the grid bounds:\n   - **Unopened Check**: If the cell at (r, c) is unopened (i.e., `clicked[r, c]` is False), its coordinates are added to the list of unopened neighbors.\n   - **Flagged Check**: If the cell at (r, c) is flagged (i.e., `flags[r, c]` is True), the flagged count is incremented.\n4. **Sorting**: The list of unopened neighbors is sorted lexicographically (first by row, then by column) to meet the output requirements.\n5. **Result Return**: The function returns the sorted list of unopened neighbors and the count of flagged neighbors.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all valid neighbors, categorizes them, and ensures the results are presented in the required format.

This ensures each split point is evaluated only once per unique value.\n4. **Threshold Evaluation**: For each threshold (except the last unique value to ensure the right subset is non-empty), the dataset is split into left and right subsets based on whether the feature values are less than or equal to the threshold.\n5. **MSE Calculation**: The weighted MSE is computed using the population variance of the target values in each subset. The weights are the proportions of samples in each subset relative to the total number of samples.\n6. **Best Split Tracking**: The algorithm checks if the current split's MSE is better than the best MSE found so far. If it is, the best split parameters are updated. In case of ties, the split with the smallest feature index and threshold is chosen.\n7. **Result Rounding**: The best MSE is rounded to four decimal places before returning the result as a list containing the best feature index, threshold, and MSE.\n\nThis approach efficiently evaluates all possible splits for each feature, ensuring the optimal split is found based on the weighted MSE criterion."}
{"task_id": 598, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to standardize each feature (column) of a given data matrix such that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The solution involves handling various edge cases, such as when a feature's standard deviation is zero or when the standardization results in NaN or infinite values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Data to NumPy Array**: This allows us to leverage NumPy's efficient vectorized operations for mean and standard deviation calculations.\n2. **Compute Mean and Standard Deviation**: For each feature (column), compute the mean (\u00b5) and population standard deviation (\u03c3) with `ddof=0`.\n3. **Standardize Features**: For each value in the feature, subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation. If the standard deviation is zero, all values in the feature should be set to zero.\n4. **Handle NaN and Infinite Values**: After standardization, replace any NaN or infinite values with zero.\n5. **Round and Convert Back to List**: Round the results to four decimal places and convert the NumPy array back to a nested Python list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef standardize(data: list[list[int | float]]) -> list[list[float]]:\n    \"\"\"Standardise a numeric data matrix feature-wise.\n\n    The function must transform every column so that it has zero mean and unit\n    variance (z-score).

The standard deviation uses `ddof=0` to ensure it is the population standard deviation.\n3. **Standardization**: Each element in the column is transformed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. If the standard deviation is zero (indicating a constant column), all elements in that column are set to zero.\n4. **Handling NaN and Infinite Values**: After standardization, any NaN or infinite values resulting from division by zero or other operations are replaced with zero.\n5. **Rounding and Conversion**: The results are rounded to four decimal places and converted back to a nested Python list to meet the output requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the standardization process while addressing edge cases such as constant columns and invalid values, ensuring the output is clean and formatted correctly."}
