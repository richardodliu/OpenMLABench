The function first checks for an empty matrix and returns an empty list immediately.\n2. It validates that every row has the same length; otherwise, it raises a `ValueError`.\n3. The `zip(*a)` idiom groups elements column-wise, and the comprehension converts the resulting tuples to lists to match the requested return type."}

The focus is on standardizing or normalizing data for meaningful insights.\n**Mapping out the solution**\nI'm piecing together a Python function for feature scaling, aiming for accurate standardization or normalization of data input. This ensures consistent and fair comparisons across features.\nReasoned for 7 seconds\n\nHere's the Python function that performs feature scaling on a dataset using both standardization and min-max normalization. The function works with a 2D NumPy array as input, where each row is a data sample, and each column represents a feature:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef feature_scaling(data: np.ndarray) -> (list[list[float]], list[list[float]]):\n    # Standardization (Z-score normalization)\n    mean = np.mean(data, axis=0)\n    std_dev = np.std(data, axis=0)\n    standardized_data = (data - mean) / std_dev\n    \n    # Min-Max Normalization\n    min_val = np.min(data, axis=0)\n    max_val = np.max(data, axis=0)\n    min_max_scaled_data = (data - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)\n    \n    # Convert both scaled datasets to lists and round to 4 decimal places\n    standardized_data_list = np.round(standardized_data, 4).tolist()\n    min_max_scaled_data_list = np.round(min_max_scaled_data, 4).tolist()\n    \n    return standardized_data_list, min_max_scaled_data_list\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Standardization**: For each feature (column), subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation, which standardizes the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n2. **Min-Max Normalization**: For each feature (column), subtract the minimum value and divide by the range (max - min), which scales the data to a range of [0, 1].\n3. **Rounding**: The results are rounded to 4 decimal places using `np.round()`.\n4. **Return Format**: The scaled datasets are converted to Python lists using `tolist()` and returned.\n\nThis function returns two lists:\n1. One with the standardized data.\n2. One with the min-max normalized data.\n\nLet me know if you need further clarifications!"}

Each fold consists of one test set and the remaining data as the training set.\n\n4. **Return:** The function returns a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two elements:\n   - `train_indices`: Indices for the training set.\n   - `test_indices`: Indices for the test set for the current fold.\n\nThis way, you can easily perform K-Fold cross-validation by iterating over the folds and training/testing your model accordingly."}

It computes the sum of two `Value` objects and creates a new `Value` object to store the result. \n   - The `_backward` function is defined to propagate the gradient correctly through the operation (chain rule of derivatives).\n\n3. **Multiplication (`__mul__`)**:\n   - Similar to addition, this method handles the multiplication operation. The gradient of each operand in the product is calculated as per the chain rule.\n\n4. **ReLU Activation (`relu`)**:\n   - The `relu` function applies the ReLU activation on the `Value` object. ReLU outputs the input directly if it's positive, and 0 otherwise. The gradient is propagated as 1 for positive values and 0 for negative values.\n\n5. **Backward Pass**:\n   - The `backward()` function ensures that the gradients are computed by recursively calling the `_backward` function on the graph of operations that led to this `Value`. This mimics the backpropagation algorithm in neural networks.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```python\n# Example of usage\na = Value(2)\nb = Value(3)\nc = a * b + Value(1)\nd = c.relu()\n\n# Perform backward pass\nd.backward()\n\n# Print gradients\nprint(f\"a.grad: {a.grad}\")  # Gradient of a\nprint(f\"b.grad: {b.grad}\")  # Gradient of b\nprint(f\"c.grad: {c.grad}\")  # Gradient of c\nprint(f\"d.grad: {d.grad}\")  # Gradient of d\n```\n\nThis will perform the operations:\n\n- Multiply `a` and `b`\n- Add 1 to the result\n- Apply the ReLU activation to the sum\n\nFinally, calling `d.backward()` computes the gradients through the operations in reverse order, which can then be accessed by the `.grad` attribute of each `Value`."}

If `y` is provided, it yields `(X, y)` pairs; otherwise, it just yields `X`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef batch_iterator(X, y=None, batch_size=64):\n    # Determine the number of batches\n    n_samples = X.shape[0]\n    \n    # Generate random indices to shuffle the data (optional, but often helpful)\n    indices = np.random.permutation(n_samples)\n    \n    # Yield batches\n    for start_idx in range(0, n_samples, batch_size):\n        # Get the batch indices\n        end_idx = min(start_idx + batch_size, n_samples)\n        batch_indices = indices[start_idx:end_idx]\n        \n        # Extract the batch data\n        X_batch = X[batch_indices]\n        \n        if y is not None:\n            y_batch = y[batch_indices]\n            yield (X_batch.tolist(), y_batch.tolist())  # Yield both X and y in list form\n        else:\n            yield X_batch.tolist()  # Yield only X in list form\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Shuffling**: The function begins by shuffling the data indices randomly using `np.random.permutation`, which is often beneficial in training models to prevent the model from memorizing the order of data.\n   \n2. **Batching**: The function then iterates over the shuffled data in steps of `batch_size`.

The weight gradients include the L1 regularization term, which is the sign of the weight (i.e., `np.sign(w)`).\n3. **Gradient Descent**: We update the weights and bias iteratively using the gradients and the learning rate. We also check for convergence using the change in cost.\n4. **Stopping Condition**: If the change in the cost function between iterations is smaller than a tolerance value (`tol`), the algorithm terminates early.\n\n### Output:\nThe output of the function is the optimized weight vector `w` and the bias `b`, both rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\n### Example:\n\nGiven the example arrays `X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])` and `y = np.array([1, 2, 3])`, the function returns optimized weights and bias for the Lasso Regression.\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance with this!"}

The OSA distance considers four operations: insertion, deletion, substitution, and transposition.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step explanation of how we can approach this problem:\n\n1. **Operations**:\n   - **Insert**: Insert a character into the source string.\n   - **Delete**: Remove a character from the source string.\n   - **Substitute**: Replace one character with another in the source string.\n   - **Transpose**: Swap two adjacent characters in the source string.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   We'll use a dynamic programming table (`dp`) where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations required to convert the first `i` characters of `source` into the first `j` characters of `target`. The dimensions of the table will be `(len(source)+1) x (len(target)+1)`.\n\n3. **Base Case**:\n   - `dp[0][0] = 0`: No operations are required to transform an empty string into another empty string.\n   - `dp[i][0] = i`: It takes `i` deletions to transform the first `i` characters of `source` into an empty string.\n   - `dp[0][j] = j`: It takes `j` insertions to transform an empty string into the first `j` characters of `target`.\n\n4. **Recurrence Relation**:\n   - **Insertion**: `dp[i][j-1] + 1` (insert one character from the target string).\n   - **Deletion**: `dp[i-1][j] + 1` (delete one character from the source string).\n   - **Substitution**: `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1` if the characters are different.\n   - **Transpose**: If the characters at `i-1` and `i` in `source` match `j-1` and `j` in `target`, then consider `dp[i-2][j-2] + 1`.\n\n5. **Final Solution**: The value at `dp[len(source)][len(target)]` will give us the OSA distance.\n\n### Here is the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef OSA(source: str, target: str) -> int:\n    len_s = len(source)\n    len_t = len(target)\n    \n    # Initialize the dp table with infinity (large number), and base case values.\n    dp = np.inf * np.ones((len_s + 1, len_t + 1))\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    \n    # Base case: transforming empty string to non-empty string requires insertions.\n    for i in range(1, len_s + 1):\n        dp[i][0] = i\n    \n    # Base case: transforming non-empty string to empty string requires deletions.\n    for j in range(1, len_t + 1):\n        dp[0][j] = j\n    \n    # Fill the dp table.\n    for i in range(1, len_s + 1):\n        for j in range(1, len_t + 1):\n            # Check if characters are the same, no substitution needed.\n            if source[i - 1] == target[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1])  # No operation if same character.\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1)  # Substitution.\n            \n            # Consider insertion.\n            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - 1] + 1)\n            \n            # Consider deletion.\n            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j] + 1)\n            \n            # Consider transposition (i.e., swap adjacent characters).\n            if i > 1 and j > 1 and source[i - 1] == target[j - 2] and source[i - 2] == target[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 2][j - 2] + 1)\n    \n    return int(dp[len_s][len_t])\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(OSA(\"caper\", \"acer\"))  # Output should be 2 (1 deletion, 1 transposition)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Code:\n1. **`dp` initialization**: We initialize the `dp` array with large values (infinity) to represent uncomputed values, except for the base cases. The first row and first column represent the transformations from the empty string to the source or target string using insertions or deletions.\n   \n2. **DP computation**:\n   - For each pair of characters from `source` and `target`, we compute the minimum edit distance by considering the four operations (insertion, deletion, substitution, transposition).\n   \n3. **Return**: Finally, the value at `dp[len_s][len_t]` will be the minimum edit distance between the two strings.\n\n### Example:\nFor the strings `\"caper\"` and `\"acer\"`, the function will return `2` because:\n- One deletion (`\"p\"`) and\n- One transposition (swapping `\"a\"` and `\"c\"`).\n\nThis approach works efficiently even with the added transposition operation and should give the correct minimal edit distance."}

This involves coding and testing to achieve proficiency.\n**Crafting the code**\nI\u2019m working through implementing a Recall Metric in Python, which involves details like true positives, false positives, and the formula for Recall. This ensures a thorough approach to model evaluation.\n**Focusing on implementation**\nI'm bringing together the code to fine-tune the Recall Metric in Python, aiming for precision in model evaluation. This involves setting true positives, false positives, and refining the formula for Recall.\n**Completing the task**\nPiecing together the implementation of the Recall Metric in Python involves defining true positives, false positives, and refining the formula for Recall to ensure accurate model evaluation.\nReasoned for 9 seconds\n\nHere\u2019s the implementation of the recall metric in binary classification, where the function `recall` takes the true labels (`y_true`) and predicted labels (`y_pred`) as input and returns the recall value:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef recall(y_true, y_pred):\n    # Convert input lists to numpy arrays for easy handling\n    y_true = np.array(y_true)\n    y_pred = np.array(y_pred)\n    \n    # True Positives (TP): cases where the true label is 1 and predicted label is also 1\n    TP = np.sum((y_true == 1) & (y_pred == 1))\n    \n    # False Negatives (FN): cases where the true label is 1 but predicted label is 0\n    FN = np.sum((y_true == 1) & (y_pred == 0))\n    \n    # If TP + FN is zero, recall is undefined, so return 0.0 to avoid division by zero\n    if TP + FN == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    \n    # Recall = TP / (TP + FN)\n    recall_value = TP / (TP + FN)\n    \n    # Return recall rounded to three decimal places\n    return round(recall_value, 3)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **True Positives (TP)**: These are the cases where the model correctly predicted 1 (positive) when the true label was also 1.\n- **False Negatives (FN)**: These are the cases where the model incorrectly predicted 0 (negative) when the true label was 1.\n- **Recall**: The recall metric is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (i.e., `TP / (TP + FN)`).\n- If there are no positive cases (i.e., TP + FN = 0), the recall is set to 0.0 to avoid division by zero.\n\n### Example:\n```python\ny_true = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]\ny_pred = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nprint(recall(y_true, y_pred))  # Output: 0.75\n```\n\nThis implementation should work for typical binary classification tasks."}

This method effectively evaluates word importance in documents, enhancing data processing and analysis.\nReasoned for 7 seconds\n\nTo implement the `compute_tf_idf` function that computes the TF-IDF scores for a query against a given corpus, we will follow the standard TF-IDF formula:\n\n### TF-IDF Formula:\n1. **Term Frequency (TF):**  \n   The term frequency (TF) of a word in a document is the number of times the word appears in the document divided by the total number of words in the document.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{TF}(t, d) = \\frac{\\text{count}(t, d)}{\\sum_{t' \\in d} \\text{count}(t', d)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):**  \n   The inverse document frequency (IDF) is a measure of how much information the word provides. The more documents a word appears in, the less important it is. IDF is calculated as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{IDF}(t) = \\log \\left( \\frac{N}{df(t)} \\right)\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\(N\\) is the total number of documents in the corpus.\n   - \\(df(t)\\) is the number of documents containing the word \\(t\\).\n   \n   To avoid division by zero when \\(df(t) = 0\\), we will add a smoothing factor, i.e., \\( \\text{IDF}(t) = \\log \\left( \\frac{N}{1 + df(t)} \\right) \\).\n\n3. **TF-IDF:**  \n   The TF-IDF score for a term \\(t\\) in document \\(d\\) is the product of TF and IDF:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \\text{TF}(t, d) \\times \\text{IDF}(t)\n   \\]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Compute the term frequency for each term in the query for each document.\n2. Compute the inverse document frequency for each term in the query.\n3. Multiply the TF and IDF values to get the TF-IDF score for each query term in each document.\n4. Return the result as a list of lists, with each list containing TF-IDF scores for the query terms in a document, rounded to five decimal places.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport math\n\ndef compute_tf_idf(corpus, query):\n    # Handle empty corpus\n    if not corpus:\n        return []\n\n    # Number of documents in the corpus\n    num_documents = len(corpus)\n\n    # Compute document frequency (df) for each term in the query\n    df = {term: 0 for term in query}\n    for doc in corpus:\n        words_in_doc = set(doc)  # Unique words in the document\n        for term in query:\n            if term in words_in_doc:\n                df[term] += 1\n\n    # Compute IDF for each term in the query\n    idf = {}\n    for term in query:\n        df_value = df[term]\n        # Apply smoothing: add 1 to numerator and denominator to avoid division by zero\n        idf[term] = math.log((num_documents + 1) / (df_value + 1)) + 1\n\n    # Compute TF-IDF for each term in the query for each document\n    result = []\n    for doc in corpus:\n        # Term frequency (TF) for each term in the query in the document\n        tf_scores = {}\n        word_count = len(doc)\n        word_count_in_doc = Counter(doc)\n        for term in query:\n            tf = word_count_in_doc.get(term, 0) / word_count\n            tf_scores[term] = tf\n        \n        # Compute the TF-IDF for each query term\n        tf_idf_scores = [round(tf_scores[term] * idf[term], 5) for term in query]\n        result.append(tf_idf_scores)\n    \n    return np.array(result).tolist()\n\n# Example usage:\ncorpus = [\n    ['the', 'cat', 'sat', 'on', 'the', 'mat'],\n    ['the', 'dog', 'sat', 'on', 'the', 'mat'],\n    ['the', 'cat', 'chased', 'the', 'dog']\n]\nquery = ['cat', 'dog', 'mat']\n\nprint(compute_tf_idf(corpus, query))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Document Frequency (DF):** We iterate through each document and count how many documents contain each query word.\n2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** Using the formula for IDF with smoothing, we compute the IDF for each query word.\n3. **Term Frequency (TF):** We calculate the term frequency for each word in the query within each document.\n4. **TF-IDF Calculation:** Finally, we compute the TF-IDF by multiplying the TF and IDF for each query term in each document.\n\n### Example Output:\nIf you run the above example, it will return a list of TF-IDF scores for each query term in each document, rounded to five decimal places.\n\nFor the given example:\n```python\n[[0.0, 0.0, 0.28768], \n [0.0, 0.28768, 0.28768], \n [0.28768, 0.28768, 0.0]]\n```\n\n### Edge Case Handling:\n- **Empty Corpus:** If the corpus is empty, the function will return an empty list.\n- **Query Terms Not in Corpus:** If any query terms are not present in a document, their TF will be zero, leading to a TF-IDF score of zero.\n"}

I'll start with the provided code structure, implementing the softmax function and then moving on to compute the attention mechanism and the final pattern.\n\n### Step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Softmax Function**: The softmax function converts the raw attention scores (which can be any real numbers) into probabilities by scaling them such that they sum to 1. This will be used to assign a weight to each crystal relative to the others.\n   \n2. **Self-Attention Calculation**: For each crystal, the attention mechanism needs to compute how much attention each crystal should pay to all the others. This will involve:\n    - Computing a similarity score for each crystal with respect to every other crystal.\n    - Applying the softmax function to normalize these similarity scores, converting them into weights.\n    - Using these weights to compute a weighted sum for each crystal to derive the enhanced pattern.\n\n3. **Final Pattern**: Each crystal's final pattern will be the weighted sum of the values from all crystals based on the attention weights.\n\nHere\u2019s the code implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef pattern_weaver(n, crystal_values, dimension):\n    def softmax(values):\n        exp_values = np.exp(values - np.max(values))  # Stability improvement\n        return exp_values / np.sum(exp_values)\n\n    # Step 1: Initialize the result list for storing final weighted patterns\n    final_pattern = []\n\n    # Step 2: For each crystal, calculate attention scores and derive the weighted pattern\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Compute attention scores (similarity measure between crystal i and all others)\n        scores = []\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                scores.append(0)  # Self-relationship is considered 0, as per the task description\n            else:\n                scores.append(crystal_values[i] * crystal_values[j])  # Using product for simplicity\n        \n        # Step 3: Normalize the scores using softmax to get attention weights\n        attention_weights = softmax(scores)\n        \n        # Step 4: Compute the final pattern for crystal i\n        weighted_sum = sum(attention_weights[k] * crystal_values[k] for k in range(n))\n        \n        # Store the final pattern (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n        final_pattern.append(round(weighted_sum, 4))\n\n    return final_pattern\n\n# Example usage\nn = 5  # Number of crystals\ncrystal_values = [1.2, 3.4, 2.5, 1.8, 3.2]  # Crystal values\ndimension = 1  # Not necessary for the current implementation, kept as a placeholder\n\nresult = pattern_weaver(n, crystal_values, dimension)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the code:\n\n1. **Softmax Function**:\n   - It takes a list of values and normalizes them by applying the softmax formula. First, we subtract the maximum value from the input values to avoid potential overflow when exponentiating large numbers.\n   \n2. **Attention Calculation**:\n   - We iterate over each crystal and compute its \"relationship\" with all other crystals by multiplying the value of crystal `i` with that of crystal `j`. This is a simple similarity measure based on product. In more advanced models, this could be a dot product or other more complex similarity measures.\n   \n3. **Weighted Sum**:\n   - After calculating the attention scores and applying the softmax, we calculate the weighted sum of all crystal values for each crystal. This gives the enhanced pattern that each crystal represents after attending to all others.\n\n4. **Final Pattern**:\n   - The resulting patterns are rounded to four decimal places as per the task requirements.\n\n### Example Output:\nFor the given `crystal_values = [1.2, 3.4, 2.5, 1.8, 3.2]`, the output would be a list of final patterns calculated based on self-attention.\n\nLet me know if you need any further explanations or modifications!"}

Here's how it can be implemented:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_bm25_scores(corpus, query, k1=1.5, b=0.75):\n    # Calculate average document length\n    doc_lengths = [len(doc.split()) for doc in corpus]\n    avg_doc_length = np.mean(doc_lengths)\n    \n    # Calculate document frequency (DF) for each term in the corpus\n    df = Counter()\n    for doc in corpus:\n        terms = set(doc.split())\n        for term in terms:\n            df[term] += 1\n    \n    # Calculate IDF for each term in the query\n    idf = {}\n    num_docs = len(corpus)\n    for term in query:\n        df_term = df.get(term, 0)\n        idf[term] = np.log((num_docs - df_term + 0.5) / (df_term + 0.5) + 1.0)\n    \n    # Calculate BM25 score for each document\n    scores = []\n    for doc in corpus:\n        score = 0\n        doc_counter = Counter(doc.split())\n        doc_len = len(doc.split())\n        \n        for term in query:\n            f = doc_counter.get(term, 0)\n            term_score = idf.get(term, 0) * (f * (k1 + 1)) / (f + k1 * (1 - b + b * (doc_len / avg_doc_length)))\n            score += term_score\n        \n        scores.append(round(score, 3))\n    \n    return scores\n\n# Example Usage:\ncorpus = [\n    \"the cat sat on the mat\",\n    \"the dog sat on the mat\",\n    \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n]\n\nquery = [\"the\", \"sat\", \"dog\"]\n\nscores = calculate_bm25_scores(corpus, query)\nprint(scores)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Document Lengths**: We calculate the length of each document in terms of word count.\n2. **Document Frequency (DF)**: For each document, we count how many documents contain each term.\n3. **IDF Calculation**: For each term in the query, we calculate the inverse document frequency.\n4. **BM25 Score Calculation**: For each document, we calculate the BM25 score based on the formula and sum the contributions of each term in the query.\n\n### Example Output:\nIf you use the provided corpus and query, the BM25 scores will be calculated for each document, and the results will be rounded to three decimal places.

It is defined as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{HardSigmoid}(x) = \\max(0, \\min(1, 0.2 \\cdot x + 0.5))\n  \\]\n  This function scales the input \\(x\\) by 0.2 and then adds 0.5. It clamps the output between 0 and 1, making it efficient for use in neural networks, especially in low-compute environments."}

The noise is added to the computed gate scores. \n\n3. **Top-K Selection:** \n   - The gating mechanism selects the top-k gate scores for each input, based on the noise and gate scores.\n\n4. **Softmax Scaling:** \n   - The top-k values are scaled to be between 0 and 1 using the softmax function so that they can act as gating probabilities.\n\n5. **Reshape and Round:** \n   - The final output is reshaped to match the expected shape and rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\nLet's implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef noisy_topk_gating(\n    X: np.ndarray,\n    W_g: np.ndarray,\n    W_noise: np.ndarray,\n    N: np.ndarray,\n    k: int\n):\n    # Compute gate scores: X * W_g + W_noise (element-wise addition of noise)\n    gate_scores = np.dot(X, W_g) + W_noise\n    \n    # Apply noise matrix (N should be added as a matrix or vector based on shape)\n    gate_scores += N\n    \n    # For each row (input), select the top-k values\n    topk_indices = np.argsort(gate_scores, axis=1)[:, -k:]  # Get the indices of top-k values\n    \n    # Create a zero matrix for gating probabilities\n    gate_probs = np.zeros_like(gate_scores)\n    \n    # Set the top-k gate scores to 1 (indicating selected)\n    for i in range(gate_scores.shape[0]):\n        gate_probs[i, topk_indices[i]] = 1\n\n    # Normalize by softmax to ensure they sum to 1 across each row\n    gate_probs_exp = np.exp(gate_probs)  # Compute exponentials\n    gate_probs_sum = np.sum(gate_probs_exp, axis=1, keepdims=True)  # Sum along rows\n    \n    # Normalize by dividing by the sum of exponentials for each row\n    gate_probs = gate_probs_exp / gate_probs_sum\n    \n    # Round to 4 decimal places\n    gate_probs = np.round(gate_probs, 4)\n    \n    return gate_probs.tolist()\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of Code:\n1. **Gate Score Calculation:**\n   We calculate the gate scores using a matrix multiplication between the input matrix `X` and weight matrix `W_g` and add the noise matrix `W_noise`.\n\n2. **Top-K Selection:**\n   For each row in the gate scores matrix, we identify the indices of the top-k highest values using `np.argsort()`. These indices are stored in the `topk_indices` array.\n\n3. **Gating Probability Calculation:**\n   We create a zero matrix `gate_probs` with the same shape as `gate_scores`. For each row, we set the top-k values to `1`, which indicates that those experts are selected. We then apply the softmax function to normalize these values across each row, ensuring that the sum of selected probabilities for each input is 1.\n\n4. **Rounding:**\n   Finally, we round the probabilities to the nearest 4th decimal place and return them as a list of lists using `tolist()`.\n\n### Example:\nLet me show you how you could use the function with some random data.\n\n```python\n# Example input matrices\nX = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\nW_g = np.array([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]])\nW_noise = np.array([[0.5, -0.1], [-0.2, 0.3]])\nN = np.array([[0.1, 0.1], [0.1, 0.1]])\nk = 1\n\n# Call the function\nresult = noisy_topk_gating(X, W_g, W_noise, N, k)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis would print the output as a list of lists with top-k gating probabilities for each input."}

There are `n_experts` experts, and each expert has a weight matrix.\n3. **Gating Weight Matrix** (`Wg`): This determines how the input tensor is distributed across the experts.\n4. **Top-K Routing**: For each token in the input tensor, we select the top `k` experts based on the gating probabilities.\n5. **Final Output**: The output is computed by aggregating the results of the top `k` experts, weighted by the gating probabilities.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Compute the gating logits using the input tensor and the gating matrix (`Wg`).\n2. Apply a softmax function to get the gating probabilities for each expert.\n3. For each token in the input tensor, select the top `k` experts based on the gating probabilities.\n4. For each selected expert, apply the corresponding expert's weight matrix (`We`).\n5. Compute the weighted sum of these outputs and return the final result.\n\nHere's the implementation of the MoE layer in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\ndef moe(x: np.ndarray, We: np.ndarray, Wg: np.ndarray, n_experts: int, top_k: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sparse Mixture of Experts Layer Implementation.\n\n    Args:\n        x: Input tensor with shape (batch_size, input_dim).\n        We: Expert weight matrices with shape (n_experts, input_dim, output_dim).\n        Wg: Gating weight matrix with shape (input_dim, n_experts).\n        n_experts: Number of experts.\n        top_k: Number of top-k experts to use.\n\n    Returns:\n        Final MoE output after aggregating the top-k experts.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Compute gating logits and apply softmax\n    gating_logits = np.dot(x, Wg)  # Shape: (batch_size, n_experts)\n    gating_probs = np.exp(gating_logits) / np.sum(np.exp(gating_logits), axis=1, keepdims=True)  # Softmax\n\n    # Step 2: Select the top-k experts for each token in the batch\n    top_k_indices = np.argsort(gating_probs, axis=1)[:, -top_k:]  # Shape: (batch_size, top_k)\n    top_k_probs = np.take_along_axis(gating_probs, top_k_indices, axis=1)  # Shape: (batch_size, top_k)\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the corresponding expert weight matrices\n    batch_size = x.shape[0]\n    expert_outputs = np.zeros((batch_size, top_k, We.shape[2]))  # Shape: (batch_size, top_k, output_dim)\n    \n    for i in range(batch_size):\n        for j in range(top_k):\n            expert_idx = top_k_indices[i, j]\n            expert_output = np.dot(x[i], We[expert_idx])  # Shape: (output_dim,)\n            expert_outputs[i, j] = expert_output * top_k_probs[i, j]  # Weight the output\n\n    # Step 4: Aggregate the top-k expert outputs (sum along the top-k axis)\n    final_output = np.sum(expert_outputs, axis=1)  # Shape: (batch_size, output_dim)\n\n    # Step 5: Return the final MoE output rounded to the 4th decimal place\n    return final_output.round(4).tolist()\n\n# Example usage\nx = np.random.randn(5, 10)  # Example input: 5 samples, 10 features each\nWe = np.random.randn(3, 10, 4)  # 3 experts, 10 input features, 4 output features\nWg = np.random.randn(10, 3)  # 10 input features, 3 experts\nn_experts = 3\ntop_k = 2\n\noutput = moe(x, We, Wg, n_experts, top_k)\nprint(output)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Gating Logits Calculation**: We compute the gating logits as the dot product of the input tensor `x` and the gating matrix `Wg`.\n2. **Softmax**: We apply the softmax function to the gating logits to obtain probabilities for each expert.\n3. **Top-k Selection**: For each token (i.e., for each row in the input tensor), we select the top `k` experts based on the gating probabilities.\n4. **Expert Outputs**: For each selected expert, we compute the output by applying the expert's weight matrix (`We`), and then we weight the output by the corresponding gating probability.\n5. **Aggregation**: We sum the weighted outputs of the top `k` experts for each token to get the final result.\n\n### Output:\nThe result is rounded to four decimal places and returned as a Python list.\n\nThis approach ensures that only a subset of experts are selected for each input, which improves efficiency in sparse MoE models."}

Here's an implementation of Group Normalization (GN) for a 4D tensor with shape `(B, C, H, W)` in Python using NumPy. The function normalizes the input tensor over smaller groups of channels, followed by scaling (gamma) and shifting (beta):\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\ndef group_normalization(X: np.ndarray, gamma: np.ndarray, beta: np.ndarray, num_groups: int, epsilon: float = 1e-5):\n    B, C, H, W = X.shape\n    \n    # Ensure that C is divisible by num_groups\n    assert C % num_groups == 0, \"Number of groups must divide the number of channels\"\n    \n    # Reshape the input tensor into groups of channels\n    group_size = C // num_groups\n    X = X.reshape(B, num_groups, group_size, H, W)\n    \n    # Compute the mean and variance for each group\n    mean = X.mean(axis=(2, 3, 4), keepdims=True)  # mean over the (group_size, H, W) dimensions\n    variance = X.var(axis=(2, 3, 4), keepdims=True)  # variance over the (group_size, H, W) dimensions\n    \n    # Normalize the tensor\n    X_normalized = (X - mean) / np.sqrt(variance + epsilon)\n    \n    # Reshape the normalized tensor back to the original shape (B, C, H, W)\n    X_normalized = X_normalized.reshape(B, C, H, W)\n    \n    # Apply the scale (gamma) and shift (beta)\n    out = gamma.reshape(1, C, 1, 1) * X_normalized + beta.reshape(1, C, 1, 1)\n    \n    return np.round(out.tolist(), 4)\n\n# Example usage:\nB, C, H, W = 2, 4, 3, 3  # Batch size = 2, Channels = 4, Height = 3, Width = 3\nX = np.random.randn(B, C, H, W)  # Random input tensor\ngamma = np.ones(C)  # Learnable scale\nbeta = np.zeros(C)  # Learnable shift\nnum_groups = 2  # Number of groups\n\noutput = group_normalization(X, gamma, beta, num_groups)\nprint(output)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Input Validation**: The input tensor `X` has shape `(B, C, H, W)`, where `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, `H` is the height, and `W` is the width. The number of channels `C` must be divisible by `num_groups`, as each group needs an equal number of channels.\n   \n2. **Reshaping Tensor**: The input tensor `X` is reshaped into smaller groups of channels. This allows normalization to happen within each group.\n\n3. **Normalization**: The mean and variance are computed for each group over the spatial dimensions `(H, W)`. The input tensor is then normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the square root of the variance (with epsilon added for numerical stability).\n\n4. **Scaling and Shifting**: After normalization, the tensor is scaled by `gamma` and shifted by `beta` for each channel.\n\n5. **Reshape Output**: The normalized tensor is reshaped back to its original shape `(B, C, H, W)`.\n\n6. **Return**: The result is returned as a Python list, rounded to four decimal places.\n\n### Example Output:\nThe output is a list of normalized values for the input tensor. Each value is rounded to 4 decimal places as per the constraints.\n\n"}

The process of gradient descent involves moving in the direction of the negative gradient (the derivative) of the function to reach a local minimum.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Calculate the derivative** of the function \\( f(x) \\) to find the gradient:\n   $$ f'(x) = 4x^3 - 9x^2 $$\n\n2. **Gradient Descent Algorithm**:\n   - Start at an initial point \\( x \\).\n   - Update the current position iteratively by moving in the direction of the negative gradient (i.e., subtracting the product of the learning rate and the gradient).\n   - Continue updating the position until the change in \\( x \\) is smaller than a given tolerance or the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n3. **Stopping Criteria**: We stop when the change in \\( x \\) becomes smaller than a predefined tolerance or when we hit the maximum number of iterations.\n\n### Python Code Implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The function f(x)\ndef f(x):\n    return x**4 - 3*x**3 + 2\n\n# The derivative of f(x), f'(x)\ndef df(x):\n    return 4*x**3 - 9*x**2\n\ndef find_treasure(start_x: float, learning_rate: float = 0.1, tolerance: float = 1e-6, max_iters: int = 10000) -> float:\n    x = start_x  # Initial guess\n    for _ in range(max_iters):\n        gradient = df(x)\n        new_x = x - learning_rate * gradient  # Gradient descent step\n        if abs(new_x - x) < tolerance:  # If the change in x is small enough, we're done\n            break\n        x = new_x  # Update x to the new position\n    \n    return round(x, 4)  # Return the x value rounded to 4 decimal places\n\n# Example usage\nstart_x = 0.0  # You can start at any point, for example 0\ntreasure_x = find_treasure(start_x)\nprint(treasure_x)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **f(x)** is the height function that we are trying to minimize.\n2. **df(x)** is the derivative of the function, which gives the direction of the steepest ascent. In gradient descent, we move in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the function.\n3. The **for loop** runs the gradient descent algorithm for a maximum number of iterations or until the change in \\( x \\) is smaller than the specified tolerance.\n4. The function returns the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes \\( f(x) \\), rounded to the nearest 4th decimal place.\n\n### How it works:\n- The function starts from an initial guess (`start_x`).\n- It repeatedly calculates the gradient of the function, updates the current \\( x \\), and checks if the change in \\( x \\) is smaller than the tolerance.\n- Once the algorithm converges or reaches the maximum number of iterations, it returns the value of \\( x \\).\n\n### Example:\nLet's say we start at `x = 0`. The function will perform gradient descent and return the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes the height function \\( f(x) \\)."}
