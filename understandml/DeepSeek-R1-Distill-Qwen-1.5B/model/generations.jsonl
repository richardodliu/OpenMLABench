{"task_id": 113, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to create a function that automates the process of running a trained model on multiple input examples and collecting the predicted outputs. The function will call another helper function for each example, process the output, and collect all predictions.\n\n### Approach\nThe function `run_examples` takes four arguments: a model callable, an input vocabulary mapping characters to indices, an inverse output vocabulary mapping indices to characters, and an iterable of input strings. The function processes each input string by calling the helper function `run_example`, which returns the predicted string. The predicted string is converted into a list of characters and added to a predictions list. The function then prints the input and output for each example and returns the list of predictions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef run_examples(model, input_vocabulary, inv_output_vocabulary, examples=None):\n    if examples is None:\n        examples = globalConstant  # Assuming globalConstant is a predefined list of example strings\n    predictions = []\n    for example in examples:\n        output = run_example(model, input_vocabulary, inv_output_vocabulary, example)\n        predictions.append(''.join(output))\n        print(f\"Input: {example}, Output: {output}\")\n    return predictions\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The function checks if the examples argument is"}
{"task_id": 356, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the prediction stored in a leaf node of a decision-tree model. The leaf node's prediction depends on whether the tree is a classification or regression tree. For classification, the leaf node holds a list or tuple of class probabilities, while for regression, it holds a single scalar value representing the mean of the target values in that region.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check the Type of Leaf Node**: Determine if the leaf node's value is a list or tuple. If it is, the leaf node corresponds to a classification tree.\n2. **Classify the Leaf Node**: For classification trees, use the numpy `argmax` function to find the index of the maximum probability value. In case of ties, the smaller index is chosen.\n3. **Handle Regression Trees**: For regression trees, directly return the scalar value stored in the leaf node.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass Leaf:\n    \"\"\"Simple container class for a tree leaf.\n\n    Args:\n        value: Either a list/tuple of class probabilities (for classification)\n               or a scalar representing the regional mean (for regression).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\ndef leaf_predict(leaf: \"Leaf\", classifier: bool):\n    \"\"\"Return the prediction stored in a decision-tree leaf.\n\n    Args:\n        leaf: A Leaf object whose `value` attribute is either a sequence of\n               class probabilities (classification) or a single number\n               (regression).\n        classifier: When True, treat the leaf as a classification tree.\n\n    Returns:\n        int | float: Predicted class index for classification; otherwise the\n                     raw scalar stored in the leaf.\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(leaf.value, (list, tuple)):\n        return np.argmax(leaf.value)\n    else:\n        return leaf.value\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Classification Handling**: The `argmax` function from the numpy library is used to find the index of the maximum value in a list or tuple. This function efficiently handles ties by returning the smallest index in case of ties.\n- **Regression Handling**: For regression trees, the leaf node's value is a scalar, so it is returned directly without any modification.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the type of tree and returns the appropriate prediction, whether it is a class index for classification or a raw scalar value for regression."}
{"task_id": 539, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the binary cross-entropy (BCE) cost for a neural network's predictions. The BCE cost is a common loss function used in binary classification problems, and it helps in measuring the performance of a classification model where the output is a probability value between 0 and 1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Understanding**: The binary cross-entropy cost function is given by:\n   \\[\n   J = -\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left[ y_i \\log(a_i) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - a_i) \\right]\n   \\]\n   where \\(a_i\\) is the predicted probability and \\(y_i\\) is the true label (0 or 1) for each sample. We need to compute this cost for all samples in the dataset.\n\n2. **Clipping Probabilities**: To avoid numerical issues when \\(a_i\\) is very close to 0 or 1, we clip the predicted probabilities to the range \\([1 \\times 10^{-15}, 1 - 1 \\times 10^{-15}]\\). This ensures that we do not take the logarithm of zero or one, which would be undefined.\n\n3. **Summing and Averaging**: After clipping, we compute the cost for each sample, sum these values, multiply by \\(-1/m\\) (where \\(m\\) is the number of samples), and return the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_cost(AL: np.ndarray, Y: np.ndarray) -> float:\n    m = AL.size\n    clipped_AL = np.clip(AL,"}
