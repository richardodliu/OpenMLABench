This allows for consistent handling of scalars, lists, and NumPy arrays.\n  \n2. **Tanh Calculation**: The hyperbolic tangent of `z` is computed using `np.tanh(z)`.\n\n3. **Derivative Calculation**: The derivative is calculated using the formula \\( g'(z) = 1 - \\text{tanh}(z)^2 \\).\n\n4. **Rounding**: The results are rounded to four decimal places using `np.round(grad, 4)`.\n\n5. **Return Value**: The function checks if the input was a scalar using `np.isscalar(z)`.

For each layer, we will enqueue its neighbors and keep track of the path taken to reach them.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: Once we reach the \"output_realtime\" layer, we can reconstruct the path from the recorded paths.\n\n4. **Lexicographical Order**: If multiple paths exist, we will ensure to keep track of the lexicographically smallest path.\n\n5. **Return Result**: If we reach \"output_realtime\", return the path; otherwise, return an empty list.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef extract_realtime_model(graph: dict[str, list[str]]) -> list[str]:\n    \"\"\"Find a shortest path from 'input' to 'output_realtime'.\n\n    The *model* is given as an adjacency list `graph` where every key is the\n    name of a layer and the associated list contains the names of its outgoing\n    neighbours.\n\n    The function must return the names of the layers that lie on ONE shortest\n    path starting at the layer named ``\"input\"`` and ending at the layer named\n    ``\"output_realtime\"``. If several shortest paths are possible the\n    lexicographically smallest one (as complete lists) is returned.

If so, it returns `-1`.\n2. **Matrix Creation**: A 2-D matrix `A` is created with dimensions `(d0, d1)` filled with samples from a standard normal distribution.\n3. **SVD Calculation**: The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of `A` is computed, yielding matrices `U`, `\u03a3`, and `V\u1d40`.\n4. **Choosing the Orthogonal Matrix**: Depending on the shape of `U`, either `U` or `V\u1d40` is selected as the orthogonal matrix `Q`.\n5. **Reshaping and Scaling**: The orthogonal matrix `Q` is reshaped to the desired output shape and scaled by the specified factor.\n6. **Return Value**: The resulting matrix is converted to a Python list and returned.\n\n### Testing the Output:\nYou can run the provided example to see the output. The orthogonality condition can be verified by checking the dot product of the reshaped result against the identity matrix, scaled by `scale**2`."}

If it finds one, it immediately returns the index of that arm.\n\n2. **UCB Score Calculation**: If all arms have been pulled at least once, it calculates the UCB score for each arm using the formula provided. The score combines the empirical mean reward and an exploration term that encourages trying less-pulled arms.\n\n3. **Selecting the Best Arm**: Finally, it finds the index of the arm with the highest UCB score. In case of ties, the `index` method will return the first occurrence, which aligns with the requirement to choose the arm with the smallest index in case of a tie.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and adheres to the UCB1 algorithm's principles, ensuring that it can handle any number of arms and valid input parameters."}

If no matches are found, we return `-1`.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nprint(parse_activation(\"ReLU\"))  # {'type': 'ReLU'}\nprint(parse_activation(\"Affine(slope=2.5, intercept=-1.0)\"))  # {'type': 'Affine', 'slope': 2.5, 'intercept': -1.0}\nprint(parse_activation(\"Leaky ReLU(alpha=0.01)\"))  # {'type': 'Leaky ReLU', 'alpha': 0.01}\nprint(parse_activation(\"Invalid Function\"))  # -1\n```\n\nThis implementation should correctly parse the specified activation function formats and handle invalid inputs as required."}

Each vertex points to a list of its outgoing neighbors.\n\n2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function performs the following:\n   - It checks if the vertex is already in the current path (`temp_mark`). If it is, a cycle is detected, and we return `False`.\n   - If the vertex has already been visited, we return `True` to skip further processing.\n   - We add the vertex to the `temp_mark` to indicate it's being processed.\n   - We recursively call `dfs` on each neighbor in the order they appear in the adjacency list.\n   - After exploring all neighbors, we remove the vertex from `temp_mark`, mark it as visited, and add it to the `topological_order`.\n\n3. **Cycle Detection**: If any call to `dfs` returns `False`, we immediately return `None`, indicating that a cycle exists.\n\n4. **Final Order**: After processing all vertices, we reverse the `topological_order` list to get the correct order since we append vertices after exploring their neighbors.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the topological sort is deterministic and adheres to the specified constraints."}

Each entry in the queue is a tuple containing the total estimated cost (`f`), the cost from the start to the current node (`g`), and the current node's coordinates.\n3. **Exploring Neighbors**: For each cell, the algorithm checks its four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor is within bounds and is a free cell (0), it calculates the new cost and updates the priority queue if this path is better than any previously found path to that neighbor.\n4. **Destination Check**: If the destination is reached, the function returns the cost `g`, which represents the number of moves taken to reach the destination.\n5. **Return Value**: If the destination is unreachable, the function returns -1.\n\nThis implementation efficiently finds the shortest path using the A* algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic."}

It takes the current dictionary to flatten, a `parent_key` to keep track of the current key path, and a separator (default is `.`).\n3. **Iteration**: The function iterates over each key-value pair in the current dictionary.\n4. **Key Construction**: For each key, it constructs a new key by appending the current key to the `parent_key` using the specified separator.\n5. **Recursion**: If the value is a dictionary, it calls itself recursively to flatten that dictionary.

It ensures that `y` is a 1-D array for easier manipulation.\n\n2. **Mean-Centering**: The mean of each feature in `X` and the mean of `y` are computed. The data is then mean-centered by subtracting the mean from each feature and the target.\n\n3. **Weight Calculation**: The optimal weights are calculated using the closed-form solution. If the matrix to be inverted is singular, the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse is used instead.\n\n4. **Bias Calculation**: The bias term is recovered by adjusting the mean of `y` with the mean of `X` and the calculated weights.\n\n5. **Rounding**: Finally, both the weights and the bias are rounded to four decimal places before being returned.\n\nThis implementation should work correctly for any valid input data and handle cases where the matrix inversion might fail."}

{"task_id": 559, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve the problem of collecting leaf values from a binary tree, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The idea is to traverse the tree recursively, checking each node to see if it is a leaf (i.e., it has no left or right children). If it is a leaf, we add its value to a list. If it is not a leaf, we continue traversing its children.\n\nHere's how we can implement the `leaf_values` function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Optional\n\nclass Node:\n    \"\"\"Binary-tree node used by the task.\n\n    Attributes:\n        val:     The value stored in the node.

It has attributes for the value (`val`), left child (`left`), and right child (`right`).\n\n2. **leaf_values Function**:\n   - We define a nested function `dfs` that performs a depth-first search on the tree.\n   - If the current node is `None`, we return immediately (base case).\n   - If the current node is a leaf (both left and right children are `None`), we append its value to the `leaves` list.\n   - If the current node is not a leaf, we recursively call `dfs` on the left and right children.\n\n3. **Return Value**: After the DFS traversal is complete, we return the `leaves` list, which contains all the leaf values collected in left-to-right order.\n\n### Example Usage:\nYou can test the function with the provided example:\n\n```python\n# Example construction\nroot = Node(\n    left=Node(val=1),\n    right=Node(\n        left=Node(val=2),\n        right=Node(val=3)\n    )\n)\n\n# Calling the function\nprint(leaf_values(root))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThis implementation efficiently collects all leaf values from the binary tree in the required order."}
