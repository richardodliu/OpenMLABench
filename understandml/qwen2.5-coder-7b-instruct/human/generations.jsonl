The OSA distance is a variation of the Levenshtein distance, which allows for transpositions in addition to insertions, deletions, and substitutions.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements the OSA distance calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef OSA(source: str, target: str) -> int:\n    m, n = len(source), len(target)\n    \n    # Create a 2D array to store the distances\n    dp = np.zeros((m + 1, n + 1), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Initialize the base cases\n    for i in range(m + 1):\n        dp[i, 0] = i\n    for j in range(n + 1):\n        dp[0, j] = j\n    \n    # Fill the dp array\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if source[i - 1] == target[j - 1]:\n                cost = 0\n            else:\n                cost = 1\n            \n            dp[i, j] = min(\n                dp[i - 1, j] + 1,      # Deletion\n                dp[i, j - 1] + 1,      # Insertion\n                dp[i - 1, j - 1] + cost  # Substitution\n            )\n            \n            if i > 1 and j > 1 and source[i - 1] == target[j - 2] and source[i - 2] == target[j - 1]:\n                dp[i, j] = min(dp[i, j], dp[i - 2, j - 2] + 1)  # Transposition\n    \n    return dp[m, n]\n\n# Example usage:\nsource = \"caper\"\ntarget = \"acer\"\nprint(OSA(source, target))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We create a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` where `m` is the length of `source` and `n` is the length of `target`. This array will store the OSA distances between all prefixes of `source` and `target`.\n   - We initialize the base cases where the distance from an empty string to a string of length `j` is `j` (all insertions), and the distance from a string of length `i` to an empty string is `i` (all deletions).\n\n2. **Filling the DP Table**:\n   - We iterate through each character of `source` and `target`.\n   - For each pair of characters `source[i-1]` and `target[j-1]`, we calculate the cost of substitution. If the characters are the same, the cost is 0; otherwise, it is 1.\n   - We update the `dp[i, j]` value by taking the minimum of:\n     - Deleting a character from `source` (`dp[i-1, j] + 1`)\n     - Inserting a character into `source` (`dp[i, j-1] + 1`)\n     - Substituting a character in `source` (`dp[i-1, j-1] + cost`)\n   - Additionally, if the characters `source[i-1]` and `target[j-2]` are the same and `source[i-2]` and `target[j-1]` are the same, we consider the transposition operation (`dp[i-2, j-2] + 1`).\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - The value at `dp[m, n]` will be the OSA distance between the entire `source` and `target` strings.\n\nThis implementation efficiently calculates the OSA distance using dynamic programming, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and easy to understand."}

The smoothing term `(num_docs + 1)` and `(df.get(term, 0) + 1)` ensures that we avoid division by zero.\n   - **TF-IDF**: We multiply the TF and IDF values to get the TF-IDF score for each term in the query for the current document.\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If the corpus is empty, the function returns an empty list.\n   - If a term in the query is not present in the corpus, its TF-IDF score for each document is set to 0.\n   - If a document is empty, the TF for that term in that document is also 0.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function handles various edge cases and provides robust TF-IDF scores for the given query against the corpus."}

{"task_id": 74, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this task, we need to implement a function that generates a composite hypervector for a given dataset row using Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). The function will take a dictionary representing a dataset row, the dimensionality of the hypervectors, and a dictionary of random seeds for reproducibility. Each feature in the row will be represented by binding hypervectors for the feature name and its value. The hypervectors for the values will be created using the same feature seed provided in the `random_seeds` dictionary. Finally, all feature hypervectors will be bundled to create a composite hypervector for the row.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `create_row_hv` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef create_row_hv(row, dim, random_seeds):\n    def create_hv(feature, value, dim, seed):\n        np.random.seed(seed)\n        hv = np.random.randint(2, size=dim)\n        return hv\n    \n    def bind_hv(hv1, hv2):\n        return np.bitwise_xor(hv1, hv2)\n    \n    composite_hv = np.zeros(dim, dtype=int)\n    \n    for feature, value in row.items():\n        feature_hv = create_hv(feature, value, dim, random_seeds[feature])\n        composite_hv = bind_hv(composite_hv, feature_hv)\n    \n    return composite_hv.tolist()\n\n# Example usage:\nrow = {\n    'feature1': 'value1',\n    'feature2': 'value2',\n    'feature3': 'value3'\n}\ndim = 100\nrandom_seeds = {\n    'feature1': 42,\n    'feature2': 24,\n    'feature3': 12\n}\n\ncomposite_hv = create_row_hv(row, dim, random_seeds)\nprint(composite_hv)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **create_hv Function**: This function generates a hypervector for a given feature and value using a random seed. It initializes a numpy array of zeros with the specified dimension and fills it with random integers (0 or 1) using the given seed to ensure reproducibility.\n\n2. **bind_hv Function**: This function binds two hypervectors using the bitwise XOR operation, which is a common operation in HDC to combine hypervectors.\n\n3. **create_row_hv Function**:\n   - Initializes a composite hypervector of zeros with the specified dimension.\n   - Iterates over each feature-value pair in the input row.\n   - Creates a hypervector for each feature-value pair using the `create_hv` function.\n   - Binds the created hypervector to the composite hypervector using the `bind_hv` function.\n   - Returns the composite hypervector as a list.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the composite hypervector is generated reproducibly and efficiently using Hyperdimensional Computing principles."}

The number of matches is the sum of the minimum counts of each token in both sentences.\n3. **Precision and Recall**: Precision is the number of matches divided by the length of the candidate sentence, and recall is the number of matches divided by the length of the reference sentence.\n4. **F-mean**: The F-mean is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n5. **Word Order Penalty**: The penalty is calculated using an exponential function that penalizes low F-mean values.\n6. **METEOR Score**: The final score is computed by combining the F-mean and the word order penalty, with a weight `alpha` for the F-mean and `1 - alpha` for the penalty.\n\nThis implementation should give you a good starting point for evaluating the quality of machine translations using the METEOR score."}
