If it's not invertible, the function returns `[-1]`."}

The input `x` can be a scalar (`int` or `float`), a Python list, or a NumPy array. The function should return a tuple containing the sigmoid of `x` and its gradient, both rounded to 4 decimal places. If `x` is a scalar, the return values should be `float`; if `x` is array-like, the return values should be Python lists.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the input to a NumPy array for uniform processing\nTo handle different types of input uniformly, we first need to convert the input into a NumPy array if it's not already one. This includes converting Python lists to NumPy arrays.\n\n## Step 3: Compute the sigmoid of the input\nThe sigmoid function is defined as $\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$. We will use NumPy's vectorized operations to compute this for all elements of the input array.\n\n## Step 4: Compute the gradient of the sigmoid\nThe derivative of the sigmoid function is given by $\\sigma'(x) = \\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x))$.

{"task_id": 32, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "## Step 1: Understand the task requirements\nThe task requires implementing a function `check_data(a, b)` that validates and converts two inputs to numeric values. It should accept integers, floats, or numeric strings, convert strings to numeric values using `float()`, and leave existing numeric values unchanged. The function should return the cleaned values as a tuple.\n\n## Step 2: Implement the `check_data(a, b)` function\nTo implement `check_data(a, b)`, we need to check the type of each input and convert it to a numeric value if necessary. We will use `isinstance()` to check if a value is of a certain type.\n\n## Step 3: Check the type of each input and convert if necessary\nFor each input `a` and `b`, we need to check if it's a string, int, or float. If it's a string, we convert it to a float. If it's already a numeric type (int or float), we leave it as is.\n\n## Step 4: Write the `check_data(a, b)` function\n```python\ndef check_data(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Validate and convert the two inputs so that both are numeric.\n\n    The function must accept integers, floats, or numeric strings.

It uses `check_data(a, b)` to validate and convert the inputs before passing them to the decorated function.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the `validate_input` decorator to `sum_numbers(a, b)`\nThe `sum_numbers(a, b)` function is already decorated with `@validate_input`. This means that before `sum_numbers(a, b)` is executed, its inputs will be validated and converted by `check_data(a, b)` through the decorator.\n\n## Step 7: Ensure the output of `sum_numbers(a, b)` meets the constraints\nThe function should return a normal Python `int` when the result is an integer; otherwise, it should return a `float`. We need to modify `sum_numbers(a, b)` to achieve this.\n\n## Step 8: Modify `sum_numbers(a, b)` to return `int` or `float` as required\nTo return an `int` if the sum is an integer and a `float` otherwise, we can check if the sum is equal to its integer value.\n\n## Step 9: Implement the modified `sum_numbers(a, b)`\n```python\n@validate_input\ndef sum_numbers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Return the arithmetic sum of *a* and *b* after validation.\"\"\"\n    sum_value = a + b\n    if sum_value.is_integer():\n        return int(sum_value)\n    else:\n        return sum_value\n```\n\n## Step 10: Combine the code\nThe complete code will include the implementation of `check_data(a, b)` and the decorated `sum_numbers(a, b)` function.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```python\ndef check_data(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Validate and convert the two inputs so that both are numeric.\n\n    The function must accept integers, floats, or numeric strings.

If not, it immediately returns `-1`.\n2. **Seeding**: If a `seed` is provided, the function seeds NumPy's random number generator with this value to ensure reproducibility.\n3. **Random Array Generation**: It generates a random array of the specified `shape` using `np.random.rand`. The values in this array are uniformly distributed in the interval \\([0,1)\\).\n4. **Binary Thresholding**: The function then applies a threshold to this random array. Entries that are greater than or equal to \\(1 - sparsity\\) are set to `1.0`, and others are set to `0.0`. This is achieved by the expression `(random_array >= (1 - sparsity))`, which produces a boolean array that is then cast to `np.float64` to meet the output requirements.\n5. **Return**: The resulting binary array is returned. If the input `sparsity` is out of range, the function returns `-1` as per the task requirements.\n\n### Example Usage:\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `random_binary_tensor` function with a specified `shape`, `sparsity`, and `seed`, and prints the resulting binary tensor."}

Collect row indices of values less than the median into `left` and those greater than the median into `right`.\n\n5. **Sort `left` and `right`**: Sort the lists `left` and `right` in ascending order.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Return a 3-tuple containing the row index of the median value (`pivot`), the sorted list of row indices with smaller values (`left`), and the sorted list of row indices with larger values (`right`).\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_split(data: np.ndarray, d: int) -> tuple[int, list[int], list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"Split *data* along column *d* by its median value.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    data : np.ndarray\n        2-D array of shape (n_samples, n_features).\n    d : int\n        Index of the column to use for the split.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple\n        (pivot, left, right) where\n        \u2022 pivot is the row index whose value in column *d* is the median;\n        \u2022 left  is a list of row indices with smaller values;\n        \u2022 right is a list of row indices with larger  values.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_samples = data.shape[0]\n    column = data[:, d]\n    idx_median = np.argpartition(column, n_samples // 2)[n_samples // 2]\n    median_value = column[idx_median]\n    pivot = idx_median\n    \n    left = [i for i in range(n_samples) if column[i] < median_value]\n    right = [i for i in range(n_samples) if column[i] > median_value]\n    \n    left.sort()\n    right.sort()\n    \n    return pivot, left, right\n```"}
{"task_id": 40, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the requirements\nThe task is to implement a function `to_frames` that takes a 1-D NumPy array `x`, a positive integer `frame_width`, and a positive hop length `stride`, and returns a view on `x` with shape `(n_frames, frame_width)` where `n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1`. The function should use `numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided` to create a view on the original signal without copying it.\n\n## Step 2: Check the pre-conditions\nTo ensure the function works correctly, we need to check the pre-conditions:\n1. `x` is one-dimensional.\n2. `stride` is greater than or equal to 1.\n3. `len(x)` is greater than or equal to `frame_width`.\nWe will use `assert` statements to check these conditions.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate `n_frames`\nWe need to calculate `n_frames` based on the given formula: `n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1`. This will determine the number of rows in the output array.\n\n## Step 4: Use `as_strided` to create the view\n`as_strided` allows us to create a view on `x` with a different shape and strides. The new shape will be `(n_frames, frame_width)`. The stride for the second dimension (columns) remains the same as `x.strides[0]`, which is the stride of `x` since it's a 1-D array. The stride for the first dimension (rows) will be `stride * x.strides[0]`, because we are moving `stride` steps at a time.\n\n## Step 5: Set the writability of the returned view\nThe `writeable` parameter controls whether the returned view is writable. If `writeable` is `False`, the returned array should be read-only. Otherwise, it should inherit the writability of `x`.\n\n## Step 6: Implement the function\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.lib.stride_tricks import as_strided\n\ndef to_frames(x: np.ndarray, frame_width: int, stride: int, writeable: bool = False) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Convert a 1-D signal into overlapping frames.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : np.ndarray\n        One-dimensional input signal of length *N*.\n    frame_width : int\n        The length (*in samples*) of each output frame.\n    stride : int\n        Hop length \u2013 number of samples between the starts of successive frames.\n    writeable : bool, default=False\n        If *False* the returned view is read-only; if *True* it is writeable\n        whenever the source array was writeable.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    np.ndarray\n        A view on *x* with shape ``(n_frames, frame_width)`` where\n        ``n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1``.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check pre-conditions\n    assert x.ndim == 1, \"x must be one-dimensional\"\n    assert stride >= 1, \"stride must be greater than or equal to 1\"\n    assert len(x) >= frame_width, \"len(x) must be greater than or equal to frame_width\"\n\n    # Calculate n_frames\n    n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1\n\n    # Create a view on x using as_strided\n    framed_x = as_strided(x, shape=(n_frames, frame_width), strides=(stride * x.strides[0], x.strides[0]))\n\n    # Set the writability of the returned view\n    framed_x.flags.writeable = writeable and x.flags.writeable\n\n    return framed_x\n```\n\n## Step 7: Verify the implementation\nThe implementation should be verified to ensure it meets all the requirements, including returning a view on the original data, having the correct shape, and adhering to the writability constraint.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.lib.stride_tricks import as_strided\n\ndef to_frames(x: np.ndarray, frame_width: int, stride: int, writeable: bool = False) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Convert a 1-D signal into overlapping frames.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : np.ndarray\n        One-dimensional input signal of length *N*.\n    frame_width : int\n        The length (*in samples*) of each output frame.\n    stride : int\n        Hop length \u2013 number of samples between the starts of successive frames.\n    writeable : bool, default=False\n        If *False* the returned view is read-only; if *True* it is writeable\n        whenever the source array was writeable.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    np.ndarray\n        A view on *x* with shape ``(n_frames, frame_width)`` where\n        ``n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1``.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check pre-conditions\n    assert x.ndim == 1, \"x must be one-dimensional\"\n    assert stride >= 1, \"stride must be greater than or equal to 1\"\n    assert len(x) >= frame_width, \"len(x) must be greater than or equal to frame_width\"\n\n    # Calculate n_frames\n    n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1\n\n    # Create a view on x using as_strided\n    framed_x = as_strided(x, shape=(n_frames, frame_width), strides=(stride * x.strides[0], x.strides[0]))\n\n    # Set the writability of the returned view\n    framed_x.flags.writeable = writeable and x.flags.writeable\n\n    return framed_x\n```"}

The function `k_smallest` takes a list of numbers `nums` and an integer `k` as input and returns the k smallest numbers in ascending order.\n2.  It first checks if `k` is valid (i.e., greater than 0 and not larger than the length of `nums`). If not, it returns -1.\n3.  It initializes an empty max-heap `max_heap` to store the k smallest numbers encountered so far.\n4.  The function then iterates over the input list `nums`. For each number, it checks if the max-heap is not full (i.e., its size is less than `k`). If so, it pushes the number into the max-heap using the `_move_up` helper function to maintain the max-heap property.\n5.  If the max-heap is full and the current number is smaller than the root of the max-heap (the largest number in the heap), it replaces the root with the current number and uses the `_move_down` helper function to restore the max-heap property.\n6.  After iterating over the entire input list, the max-heap contains the k smallest numbers. The function sorts the max-heap in ascending order using the built-in `sorted` function and returns the result.\n\nThe `_move_up` and `_move_down` helper functions are used to maintain the max-heap property after insertions and deletions. They recursively swap elements to ensure that the parent node is always larger than its child nodes in the max-heap.\n\n## Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of the `k_smallest` function is O(n log k) due to the iteration over the input list and the max-heap operations.\n*   The `_move_up` and `_move_down` helper functions have a time complexity of O(log k) because they potentially traverse the height of the max-heap.\n\n## Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity is O(k) for storing the max-heap."}

We define the `newton` function that takes in the data matrix `X`, target vector `y`, tolerance `epsilon`, and maximum iterations `max_iter`.\n2.  We initialize the weight vector `w` to `[1.0, 1.0]`.\n3.  We iterate until the stopping criteria are met (either the Euclidean norm of the gradient is below `epsilon` or the number of iterations reaches `max_iter`).\n4.  Inside the loop, we compute the gradient and Hessian of the mean squared error (MSE) and update the weight vector using Newton's method.\n5.  If the Hessian is singular, we use its Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse to ensure the algorithm works for rank-deficient data matrices.\n6.  Finally, we return the final weight vector rounded to 4 decimal places as a Python list of lists.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `newton` function with some randomly generated data."}

We need to implement this function in Python, handling scalar, list, and NumPy array inputs, and optionally returning the derivative.\n\n## Step 2: Ensure Numerically Stable Formulation\nTo avoid overflow for large positive or negative $x$, we need a numerically stable formulation. For $\\text{SoftPlus}(x)$, we can use the property that $\\log(1 + e^x) = x + \\log(1 + e^{-x})$ for $x > 0$, and $\\log(1 + e^x)$ directly for $x \\leq 0$, or utilize `np.log1p` for stability. For the derivative, $\\sigma(x)$, we can use $\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$, and to avoid overflow, we can simplify it further for large $x$ by using $1 - \\frac{1}{1 + e^x}$ for $x > 0$ and the original form for $x \\leq 0$, or directly compute it.\n\n## Step 3: Implement SoftPlus and Its Derivative in Python\nFirst, we need to convert the input to a NumPy array to handle scalar, list, and array inputs uniformly.

For $x \\leq 0$, we can directly use $\\log(1 + e^x)$, which is equivalent to using `np.log1p(np.exp(x))`. This formulation is numerically stable.\n\n## Step 5: Apply Sigmoid (Derivative of SoftPlus)\nThe derivative, $\\sigma(x)$, can be computed as $\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$.

The function `grad` starts by converting the input lists `X`, `y`, and `W` to NumPy arrays using `np.array()`.\n2.  It checks if `X` is a 2-D array and returns `-1` if not.\n3.  It reshapes `y` and `W` into column vectors if they are one-dimensional using `reshape(-1, 1)`.\n4.  The function validates the dimensions of `y` and `W` by checking if the number of rows in `y` matches the number of rows in `X`, and if the number of rows in `W` matches the number of columns in `X`. It also checks if `y` and `W` are column vectors. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns `-1`.\n5.  The gradient is computed using vectorised NumPy operations: `np.dot(X.T, np.dot(X, W) - y) / X.shape[0]`.\n6.  The resulting gradient is rounded to 4 decimal places using `np.round(gradient, 4)`.\n7.  Finally, the function returns the gradient as a nested Python list of shape `(d, 1)` using `gradient.tolist()`.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example 1: Valid input\nX = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\ny = [2, 4, 5]\nW = [1, 1]\nprint(grad(X, y, W))\n\n# Example 2: Incompatible input dimensions\nX = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\ny = [2, 4]\nW = [1, 1]\nprint(grad(X, y, W))  # Output: -1\n\n# Example 3: Invalid X dimension\nX = [1, 2, 3]\ny = [2, 4, 5]\nW = [1, 1, 1]\nprint(grad(X, y, W))  # Output: -1\n```"}

The formula to calculate $\\beta_t(i)$ is given by $\\beta_t(i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{ij} \\, b_j(o_{t+1}) \\, \\beta_{t+1}(j)$, with the initial condition $\\beta_{T-1}(i) = 1$ for all $i$, where $T$ is the length of the observation sequence, $a_{ij}$ is the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$, and $b_j(o_{t+1})$ is the emission probability of observing symbol $o_{t+1}$ in state $j$.\n\n## Step 2: Convert Input Lists to NumPy Arrays for Efficient Computation\nTo efficiently compute the backward probabilities, we first convert the given lists (transition-probability matrix $A$, emission-probability matrix $B$, and observation sequence $obs$) into NumPy arrays. This step is necessary because NumPy arrays provide vectorized operations that are much faster than iterating over Python lists.\n\n## Step 3: Initialize the Backward Probability Vector for the Last Time Step\nWe start by initializing the backward probability vector $\\beta_{T-1}$ for the last time step $T-1$. According to the given formula, $\\beta_{T-1}(i) = 1$ for all states $i$. This means we create a vector of ones with length $N$, where $N$ is the number of states.\n\n## Step 4: Implement the Backward Algorithm Iteratively\nWe then implement the backward algorithm iteratively from $T-2$ down to $t$. At each step $t$, we calculate $\\beta_t(i)$ using the formula $\\beta_t(i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{ij} \\, b_j(o_{t+1}) \\, \\beta_{t+1}(j)$. This involves matrix-vector multiplication and element-wise multiplication with the emission probabilities.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $\\beta_t$ for the Given $t$\nThe function should return $\\beta_t$ for the given time index $t$.

{"task_id": 65, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem and the Backward Algorithm\nThe task is to implement the backward algorithm for a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to calculate the probability of an observation sequence given the HMM parameters. The HMM is defined by three parameters: the transition matrix $A$, the emission matrix $B$, and the initial state distribution $\\pi$. The observation sequence is given as a list of integers.\n\n## Step 2: Check for Empty Input Lists\nFirst, we need to check if any of the input lists ($A$, $B$, $\\pi$, or $obs$) are empty. If any of them are empty, we should return $0.0$ as per the problem statement.\n\n## Step 3: Convert Input Lists to NumPy Arrays\nTo efficiently perform the calculations, we will convert the input lists into NumPy arrays. This is because NumPy arrays support vectorized operations, which are faster than iterating over Python lists.\n\n## Step 4: Initialize Backward Variables\nWe need to initialize the backward variables $\\beta_t(i)$ for $t = T-1$, where $T$ is the length of the observation sequence. The backward variables are initialized as $\\beta_{T-1}(i) = 1$ for all states $i$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate Backward Variables Recursively\nUsing the recursive formula $\\beta_t(i) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}A_{ij}\\,B_{j,o_{t+1}}\\,\\beta_{t+1}(j)$, we will calculate the backward variables for $t = T-2, T-3, \\dots, 0$. Here, $N$ is the number of states in the HMM.\n\n## Step 6: Compute the Probability of the Observation Sequence\nFinally, we will compute the probability of the observation sequence using the formula $P(O\\mid\\lambda) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\pi_i\\,B_{i,o_0}\\,\\beta_0(i)$.\n\n## Step 7: Implement the Solution in Python\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef backward_prob(A: list[list[float]], B: list[list[float]], pi: list[float], obs: list[int]) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Hidden Markov Model backward algorithm.\n\n    Given an HMM defined by transition matrix `A`, emission matrix `B`, and\n    initial distribution `pi`, compute the probability that the model\n    generates the observation sequence `obs`.\n\n    The method uses the recursive backward procedure and returns the result\n    rounded to six decimal places.\n\n    Args:\n        A: Square matrix where `A[i][j]` is the transition probability from\n           state *i* to state *j*.\n        B: Matrix where `B[i][k]` is the probability of emitting symbol *k*\n           from state *i*.\n        pi: Initial probability distribution over states.\n        obs: List of integer observation indices.\n\n    Returns:\n        A float \u2013 the sequence probability rounded to 6 decimals.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if any input list is empty\n    if not A or not B or not pi or not obs:\n        return 0.0\n    \n    # Convert input lists to NumPy arrays\n    A = np.array(A)\n    B = np.array(B)\n    pi = np.array(pi)\n    obs = np.array(obs)\n    \n    # Get the number of states and the length of the observation sequence\n    N = len(pi)\n    T = len(obs)\n    \n    # Initialize backward variables\n    beta = np.ones(N)\n    \n    # Calculate backward variables recursively\n    for t in range(T-2, -1, -1):\n        beta = np.sum(A * B[:, obs[t+1]] * beta, axis=1)\n    \n    # Compute the probability of the observation sequence\n    prob = np.sum(pi * B[:, obs[0]] * beta)\n    \n    # Return the result rounded to 6 decimal places\n    return round(prob, 6)\n```\n\n## Step 8: Example Usage\nTo test the function, you can use an example HMM and an observation sequence. For instance:\n```python\nA = [[0.7, 0.3], [0.4, 0.6]]\nB = [[0.5, 0.4, 0.1], [0.1, 0.3, 0.6]]\npi = [0.6, 0.4]\nobs = [0, 1, 2]\nprint(backward_prob(A, B, pi, obs))\n```\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.032863}$"}

The function `sgd_momentum_update` takes in the current parameters `w`, the gradient `grad`, `learning_rate`, `momentum`, and the previous momentum update `prev_update`.\n2.  If `prev_update` is `None`, it is initialized as a zero tensor with the same shape as `w`.\n3.  The new momentum update (velocity) `new_update` is computed using the formula: `momentum * prev_update + (1 - momentum) * grad`.\n4.  The parameters `w` are updated by subtracting the product of `learning_rate` and `new_update`.\n5.  The updated parameters `updated_w` and the new momentum update `new_update` are rounded to 4 decimal places and converted to Python lists before being returned.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `sgd_momentum_update` function with sample parameters and gradient, and prints the updated parameters and the new momentum update."}
{"task_id": 69, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "## Step 1: Validate the Input Dimensions\nTo start, we need to validate the input dimensions to ensure they are consistent with the requirements of the Hidden Markov Model. This includes checking the lengths and dimensions of the input lists $S$, $A$, $B$, and the list of $observations$. We need to verify that $S$ is a vector of length $n$, $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix, $B$ is an $n \\times m$ matrix, and that the observations are a list of integers.\n\n## Step 2: Convert Input Lists to NumPy Arrays\nWe will convert the input lists to NumPy arrays for easier manipulation. $S$ should be a 1D array, $A$ and $B$ should be 2D arrays.\n\n## Step 3: Check for Empty Observation Sequence\nWe need to check if the $observations$ list is empty. If it is, we should return $-1$ as per the problem statement.\n\n## Step 4: Validate Observation Indices\nWe must verify that each observation index in the $observations$ list is within the valid range $[0, m-1]$, where $m$ is the number of columns in the emission matrix $B$.\n\n## Step 5: Implement the Forward Algorithm\nThe forward algorithm is used to compute the likelihood of an observation sequence given an HMM. It involves calculating the forward probabilities $\\alpha_t(i)$, which represent the probability of being in state $i$ at time $t$ and having observed the first $t$ observations. The algorithm iterates through the observation sequence, updating these probabilities at each step using the initial state probabilities $S$, the state-transition probabilities $A$, and the emission probabilities $B$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the Initial Forward Probabilities\nAt $t = 0$, $\\alpha_0(i) = S[i] \\times B[i][observations[0]]$. This is the probability of being in state $i$ and observing the first observation.\n\n## Step 7: Update Forward Probabilities for Subsequent Observations\nFor $t > 0$, $\\alpha_t(i) = \\sum_{j} \\alpha_{t-1}(j) \\times A[j][i] \\times B[i][observations[t]]$. This step involves summing over all previous states $j$, the probability of being in $j$ at $t-1$, transitioning to $i$, and then emitting the observation at $t$.\n\n## Step 8: Compute the Likelihood of the Observation Sequence\nThe likelihood of the entire observation sequence is the sum of the forward probabilities at the last time step, $\\sum_{i} \\alpha_T(i)$, where $T$ is the length of the observation sequence.\n\n## Step 9: Return the Result\nFinally, we return the computed likelihood rounded to 4 decimal places.

This ensures that the input is in a format that can be processed element-wise, regardless of whether it's a scalar, list, or NumPy array.\n\n2. **Softplus Computation**: It then computes the softplus of `z_array` using `np.logaddexp(0.0, z_array)`, which is a numerically stable way to calculate `ln(1 + e**z_array)`. The result is stored in `softplus_values`.\n\n3. **Rounding**: The `softplus_values` are then rounded to 4 decimal places using `np.round(softplus_values, 4)`, resulting in `rounded_values`.\n\n4. **Output Formatting**: If `rounded_values` is a scalar (i.e., `rounded_values.size == 1`), it is returned as a single `float`. Otherwise, it is converted to a Python list using the `tolist()` method and returned.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Test with a NumPy array\nz = np.array([-1000, 0, 3])\nprint(softplus(z))  # Output: [0.0, 0.6931, 3.0486]\n\n# Test with a scalar\nz = 0\nprint(softplus(z))  # Output: 0.6931\n\n# Test with a Python list\nz = [-1000, 0, 3]\nprint(softplus(z))  # Output: [0.0, 0.6931, 3.0486]\n```"}

This ensures the output is JSON-serializable.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Test with a scalar\nprint(relu(-1))  # Output: ([0], [-1])\n\n# Test with a 1D array\nprint(relu([-1, 0, 1]))  # Output: ([0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 1])\n\n# Test with a 2D array\nprint(relu([[-1, 0], [1, 2]]))  # Output: ([[0, 0], [1, 2]], [[-1, 0], [1, 2]])\n```"}

The function `knn_majority_vote` takes a list of neighbour labels as input and returns the most frequent label.\n2. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each label.\n3. The maximum frequency is found using the `max` function on the values of the `Counter` object.\n4. A list comprehension is used to get the labels with the maximum frequency.\n5. The `min` function is used to return the smallest label according to Python's default ordering in case of a tie.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n* The function works with both integer and string labels.\n* It handles cases where there is a single most frequent label, as well as cases where there is a tie between multiple labels."}

If so, it immediately returns `-1` as per the task requirements.\n   \n2. **Input Handling**: The input `x` is converted to a NumPy array using `np.asarray(x)`. This allows the function to handle various input types (lists, tuples, NumPy arrays) uniformly. The `np.atleast_1d(x)` call ensures that even if `x` is a scalar, it is treated as a 1-dimensional array, simplifying the subsequent computations.\n\n3. **Gaussian PDF Computation**: The Gaussian probability density function is computed using the formula `f(x; \u03bc, \u03c3) = 1\u2044(\u221a(2\u03c0) \u03c3) \u00b7 exp(\u2212(x\u2212\u03bc)\u00b2 \u2044 (2\u03c3\u00b2))`. This is implemented using NumPy operations, which are vectorized and efficient.\n\n4. **Rounding and Output**: The computed PDF values are rounded to five decimal places using `np.round(pdf, 5)`. The result is then converted to a Python list using the `.tolist()` method before being returned.\n\n5. **Example Usage**: The code includes a `main` block that demonstrates the function's usage with different types of inputs (list, tuple, NumPy array, scalar) and edge cases (empty input, invalid `sigma`)."}

The sigmoid function will be used to calculate `p`.\n\n## Step 3: Compute `z` and `p`\nWe need to compute `z = X \u00b7 w` and then `p = \u03c3(z)`. This step involves matrix multiplication between `X` and `w`.\n\n## Step 4: Adjust `p` to Avoid Numerical Issues\nTo avoid numerical issues when computing the logarithm of `p` or `1-p`, we need to ensure that `p` is not exactly 0 or 1. We will clip `p` to be within the range `[\u03b5, 1-\u03b5]`, where `\u03b5 = 1e-20` if it falls outside this range due to the sigmoid function's output being exactly 0 or 1, but since `p` is computed using the sigmoid function, it will naturally be within (0,1). However, we still need to clip it to avoid `log(0)` issues.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the Average Binary Cross-Entropy Loss `J(w)`\nThe loss is given by `J(w) = -1/m * \u03a3 [y * ln(p) + (1-y) * ln(1-p)]`, where `m` is the number of samples. We will compute this using the adjusted `p`.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the Gradient of the Loss `\u2207J(w)`\nThe gradient is given by `\u2207J(w) = 1/m * X^T (p - y)`. This involves matrix multiplication between `X^T` and `(p - y)`.\n\n## Step 7: Implement the Function\nNow, let's put it all together into the `logistic_loss_and_gradient` function.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef logistic_loss_and_gradient(X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, w: np.ndarray) -> tuple[float, list[list[float]]]:\n    \"\"\"Compute binary cross-entropy loss and its gradient for logistic regression.\n\n    Args:\n        X (np.ndarray): Feature matrix of shape (m, n).\n        y (np.ndarray): Binary target vector of shape (m,) or (m, 1).\n        w (np.ndarray): Weight vector of shape (n,) or (n, 1).\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing\n            1.

The function `linear_regression_predict` takes in the training feature matrix `X_train`, the training target values `y_train`, and the test feature matrix `X_test`.\n2.  It first converts the input lists to NumPy arrays for efficient numerical computations.\n3.  It then prepends a column of ones to both `X_train` and `X_test` to account for the intercept term in the linear regression model.\n4.  The function computes `X^T X` and checks if it's singular by verifying if its determinant is zero. If it's singular, the function returns `-1`.\n5.  If `X^T X` is invertible, the function computes the regression coefficients using the normal equation: `(X^T X)^-1 X^T y`.\n6.  It then uses these coefficients to predict the target values for `X_test` by computing `X_test * coefficients`.\n7.  Finally, the function rounds the predictions to 4 decimal places and returns them as a list.\n\nThe provided code is a self-contained implementation of Ordinary Least Squares linear regression using the normal equation, following the specified requirements and constraints."}

{"task_id": 140, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum number of minutes an agent needs to escape a given $n \\times n$ maze while avoiding fire. The maze is represented as a list of strings where each character can be '.', '#', or 'F'. The agent starts at the upper-left corner (0,0) and wants to reach the lower-right corner $(n-1, n-1)$.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The maze is a square of size $n \\times n$.\n- Each cell in the maze can be '.', '#', or 'F'.\n- The agent starts at (0,0) and the goal is to reach $(n-1, n-1)$.\n- Fire spreads to neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) in one minute.\n- The agent can move to neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) in one minute.\n- The agent cannot enter a cell that is on fire or will be on fire when the agent arrives.\n- The start or goal cell may already be on fire, in which case the answer is -1.\n- If the maze has size $1 \\times 1$ and the single cell is '.', the answer is 0.\n- There can be multiple initial fire sources.\n\nInput: A list of strings representing the maze.\nOutput: The minimum number of minutes required for the agent to escape the maze without entering a burning cell, or -1 if it's impossible.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The fire spreads first, then the agent moves.\n- The agent can only enter a cell that is not on fire at the moment of arrival.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n1. **Simulate the spread of fire**: First, we need to simulate how the fire spreads through the maze over time. This can be done using a BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm to track when each cell will be on fire.\n\n2. **Track time of fire spread**: For each cell, we need to know the time at which it will be on fire. This information is crucial for the agent to decide whether it can safely move into a cell.\n\n3. **Agent's BFS with fire time check**: The agent should also use a BFS algorithm to explore the maze. However, the agent must check the time it will take to reach a cell against the time that cell will be on fire.\n\n4. **Check if a cell is safe for the agent**: A cell is safe for the agent if it's not on fire at the time the agent arrives. This means the agent's arrival time must be less than the fire's arrival time at that cell.\n\n5. **Handle edge cases**: We need to handle cases where the start or goal cell is already on fire, or if the maze size is $1 \\times 1$.\n\n6. **Optimization**: Using BFS for both fire spread and agent movement ensures that we find the shortest path (in terms of time) for both processes, which is essential for determining the minimum time required for the agent to escape.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. **Calculate fire spread time**: Perform a BFS from all initial fire sources to calculate the time at which each cell will be on fire. Store this information in a separate grid, `fire_time`.\n\n2. **Check if start or goal is on fire**: Immediately return -1 if the start (0,0) or goal $(n-1, n-1)$ cell is on fire at time 0.\n\n3. **Perform agent's BFS**: Start a BFS from the agent's starting position (0,0) at time 0. For each cell the agent considers moving into, check if the agent's arrival time is less than the fire's arrival time at that cell. If so, it's safe to move into that cell.\n\n4. **Explore neighbors and track time**: Explore neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) of the current cell, and track the time taken to reach each new cell. Use a queue to manage the BFS.\n\n5. **Return minimum time or -1**: If the agent successfully reaches the goal, return the time taken. If the agent cannot reach the goal without entering a burning cell, return -1.\n\n6. **Handle special case for $1 \\times 1$ maze**: If the maze size is $1 \\times 1$ and the cell is '.', return 0 as the agent is already at the goal.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef escape_fire_maze(grid: list[str]) -> int:\n    n = len(grid)\n    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n    \n    # Calculate fire time\n    fire_time = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    fire_queue = deque()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == 'F':\n                fire_queue.append((i, j))\n                fire_time[i][j] = 0\n    \n    while fire_queue:\n        x, y = fire_queue.popleft()\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] != '#' and fire_time[nx][ny] > fire_time[x][y] + 1:\n                fire_time[nx][ny] = fire_time[x][y] + 1\n                fire_queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    # Check if start or goal is on fire\n    if grid[0][0] == 'F' or grid[n-1][n-1] == 'F':\n        return -1\n    \n    # Agent's BFS\n    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    agent_queue = deque([(0, 0, 0)])  # x, y, time\n    visited[0][0] = True\n    \n    while agent_queue:\n        x, y, time = agent_queue.popleft()\n        if x == n - 1 and y == n - 1:\n            return time\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] != '#' and not visited[nx][ny] and time + 1 < fire_time[nx][ny]:\n                agent_queue.append((nx, ny, time + 1))\n                visited[nx][ny] = True\n    \n    return -1\n```"}

It first checks if the training set contains a single class by checking the number of unique values in `y_train`. If so, it predicts that class for every test example.\n3.  It initializes the weights `w` and bias `b` to zero.\n4.  The function then performs batch gradient descent for the specified number of epochs. In each epoch, it computes the predicted probabilities using the current weights and bias, computes the gradients of the negative log-likelihood with respect to the weights and bias, and updates the weights and bias using the gradients and the learning rate.\n5.  After the gradient descent iterations are complete, it makes predictions on the test set using the learned weights and bias.\n6.  Finally, it returns the predicted labels as a list.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   The learning rate and the number of epochs are hyperparameters that need to be tuned for optimal performance.\n*   The function assumes that the input data is in the form of NumPy arrays. If the data is in a different format, it may need to be converted before being passed to the function.\n*   The function uses batch gradient descent, which can be slow for large datasets. For larger datasets, stochastic gradient descent or mini-batch gradient descent may be more efficient."}

The grid is a 2D list where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a blocked cell. The A* algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that uses a best-first search and an admissible heuristic function to find the shortest path.\n\n## Step 2: Define the Grid Dimensions and Check for Validity\nFirst, we need to get the dimensions of the grid and check if the start or the goal is blocked. The grid dimensions are obtained by `rows = len(grid)` and `cols = len(grid[0])`. We then check if the start (0,0) or the goal (rows-1, cols-1) is blocked.\n\n## Step 3: Implement the A* Search Algorithm\nTo implement the A* search algorithm, we need to:\n- Define the possible movements (up, down, left, right) and their costs.\n- Use a priority queue to store the nodes to be explored, with their total cost (distance from start + heuristic) as the priority.\n- Keep track of the visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n- Reconstruct the path once the goal is reached.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the Manhattan Distance Heuristic\nThe Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

The log-loss formula is \\( \\text{LogLoss} = -\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\bigl[\\,y_i\\log(p_i) + (1-y_i)\\log(1-p_i)\\bigr] \\), where $N$ is the total number of samples, $y_i$ is the true label, and $p_i$ is the predicted probability for the positive class.\n\n## Step 2: Clip Predicted Probabilities to Avoid Logarithm of Zero or One\nTo avoid calculating the logarithm of zero or one, we need to clip the predicted probabilities to the interval $[\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon]$ where $\\varepsilon = 10^{-15}$. This step ensures that the logarithm is always defined.\n\n## Step 3: Implement the Clipping of Predicted Probabilities\nWe will use NumPy's `clip` function to clip the `predicted` probabilities. The clipping will be done between $10^{-15}$ and $1 - 10^{-15}$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the Log-Loss Using the Clipped Probabilities\nAfter clipping, we will calculate the log-loss using the given formula. This involves computing $y_i\\log(p_i) + (1-y_i)\\log(1-p_i)$ for each $i$, summing these values, and then averaging them by dividing by $N$, the total number of samples.\n\n## Step 5: Implement the Log-Loss Calculation in Python\nWe will use NumPy for efficient numerical computations. The `actual` and `predicted` sequences will be converted to NumPy arrays if they are not already. We will then compute the log-loss using vectorized operations.\n\n## Step 6: Round the Result to Six Decimal Places\nFinally, we will round the computed log-loss to six decimal places as required.\n\n## Step 7: Write the Python Function\nHere's how we can implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_log_loss(actual, predicted):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the binary classification log-loss.\n\n    Parameters:\n    actual (sequence): Ground-truth labels (0 or 1).\n    predicted (sequence): Predicted probabilities.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The average log-loss rounded to 6 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert inputs to NumPy arrays\n    actual = np.array(actual)\n    predicted = np.array(predicted)\n\n    # Check if the lengths of actual and predicted are equal\n    if len(actual) != len(predicted):\n        raise ValueError(\"Actual and predicted sequences must be of equal length\")\n\n    # Clip predicted probabilities\n    epsilon = 1e-15\n    predicted = np.clip(predicted, epsilon, 1 - epsilon)\n\n    # Calculate log-loss\n    log_loss = -np.mean(actual * np.log(predicted) + (1 - actual) * np.log(1 - predicted))\n\n    # Round the result to 6 decimal places\n    log_loss = round(log_loss, 6)\n\n    return log_loss\n```\n\n## Step 8: Example Usage\nTo use this function, simply call it with your actual labels and predicted probabilities:\n\n```python\nactual_labels = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\npredicted_probabilities = [0.2, 0.7, 0.1, 0.9, 0.3]\nprint(compute_log_loss(actual_labels, predicted_probabilities))\n```\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.310535}$"}

{"task_id": 174, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the given function signature\nThe task is to implement a function `gan_discriminator_metrics` that calculates the average categorical cross-entropy loss and the classification accuracy for a GAN discriminator given its soft-max output probabilities and one-hot encoded target labels. The function takes two `np.ndarray` parameters, `predictions` and `labels`, both of shape `(n_samples, n_classes)`, and returns a tuple of two `float` values: the loss and the accuracy, both rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the categorical cross-entropy loss\nTo calculate the categorical cross-entropy loss, we first need to understand the formula for it. The categorical cross-entropy loss for a single sample is given by $-\\sum_{i=1}^{n_classes} y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i)$, where $y_i$ is the true probability of the $i^{th}$ class (from the one-hot encoded labels) and $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted probability of the $i^{th}$ class. For a mini-batch, we average these losses. The `predictions` array contains the soft-max probabilities, and the `labels` array contains the one-hot encoded true labels.\n\n## Step 3: Implement the categorical cross-entropy loss calculation\nWe will use the formula for categorical cross-entropy loss. First, we need to ensure that we avoid taking the log of zero, which would result in infinite loss. We can clip the `predictions` to a small value greater than zero to prevent this.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the classification accuracy\nTo calculate the classification accuracy, we need to compare the predicted class (the class with the highest predicted probability) with the true class (the class with a value of 1 in the one-hot encoded label) for each sample. The accuracy is the proportion of samples where the predicted class matches the true class.\n\n## Step 5: Implement the classification accuracy calculation\nWe will use `np.argmax` to find the index of the maximum value along the appropriate axis (axis=1 for both `predictions` and `labels`) to determine the predicted and true classes, respectively. Then, we compare these to calculate the accuracy.\n\n## Step 6: Combine the loss and accuracy calculations into the function\nWe will put together the steps for calculating the loss and accuracy into the `gan_discriminator_metrics` function.\n\n## Step 7: Write the Python code for the function\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gan_discriminator_metrics(predictions: np.ndarray, labels: np.ndarray) -> tuple[float, float]:\n    \"\"\"Calculate categorical cross-entropy loss & accuracy for a GAN discriminator.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    predictions : np.ndarray\n        Soft-max probabilities with shape (n_samples, n_classes).\n    labels : np.ndarray\n        One-hot encoded true labels with the same shape as *predictions*.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple[float, float]\n        (loss, accuracy) \u2013 both rounded to 4 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clip predictions to avoid log(0)\n    epsilon = 1e-15\n    clipped_predictions = np.clip(predictions, epsilon, 1 - epsilon)\n    \n    # Calculate categorical cross-entropy loss\n    loss = -np.mean(np.sum(labels * np.log(clipped_predictions), axis=1))\n    \n    # Calculate classification accuracy\n    predicted_classes = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)\n    true_classes = np.argmax(labels, axis=1)\n    accuracy = np.mean(predicted_classes == true_classes)\n    \n    # Return loss and accuracy rounded to 4 decimal places\n    return round(float(loss), 4), round(float(accuracy), 4)\n```\n\n## Step 8: Verify the function meets the output constraints\nThe function returns a tuple of two `float` values, both rounded to 4 decimal places, as required.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gan_discriminator_metrics(predictions: np.ndarray, labels: np.ndarray) -> tuple[float, float]:\n    \"\"\"Calculate categorical cross-entropy loss & accuracy for a GAN discriminator.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    predictions : np.ndarray\n        Soft-max probabilities with shape (n_samples, n_classes).\n    labels : np.ndarray\n        One-hot encoded true labels with the same shape as *predictions*.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple[float, float]\n        (loss, accuracy) \u2013 both rounded to 4 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clip predictions to avoid log(0)\n    epsilon = 1e-15\n    clipped_predictions = np.clip(predictions, epsilon, 1 - epsilon)\n    \n    # Calculate categorical cross-entropy loss\n    loss = -np.mean(np.sum(labels * np.log(clipped_predictions), axis=1))\n    \n    # Calculate classification accuracy\n    predicted_classes = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)\n    true_classes = np.argmax(labels, axis=1)\n    accuracy = np.mean(predicted_classes == true_classes)\n    \n    # Return loss and accuracy rounded to 4 decimal places\n    return round(float(loss), 4), round(float(accuracy), 4)\n```"}
{"task_id": 175, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "# Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n1. **Understanding the task**: The task is to implement a function that computes the L2 regularization penalty for a given set of weights. The L2 penalty is defined as the product of a non-negative regularization strength $C$ and the sum of the squares of the weights.\n\n2. **Identifying the inputs and outputs**: The function takes two inputs: `weights` (a Python list or a 1-D NumPy array) and `C` (a non-negative scalar coefficient). The output is the L2 penalty rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\n3. **Breaking down the computation**: To compute the L2 penalty, we need to (1) ensure that `weights` is in a suitable format for computation, (2) square each weight and sum these squared values, (3) multiply the sum by $C$, and (4) round the result to 4 decimal places.\n\n4. **Handling different input types for `weights`**: The function should be able to handle both Python lists and 1-D NumPy arrays. We can achieve this by converting the input to a NumPy array if it's not already one, as NumPy arrays provide efficient vectorized operations.\n\n5. **Checking for edge cases**: The function should work correctly for empty or all-zero weight vectors.

It then determines the number of nearest neighbours `k` to consider, ensuring it does not exceed the number of training samples.\n* For each test sample in `X_test`, the function computes the Euclidean distance to all training samples in `X_train` using `np.linalg.norm`.

The function first attempts to convert the input `X` and `Y` to NumPy arrays with `float` data type. If this fails (e.g., due to non-numeric input), it returns `-1`.\n2.  It then checks if both `X` and `Y` are two-dimensional and if they have the same number of features (columns). If not, it returns `-1`.\n3.  The function validates that `degree` is a positive integer. If not, it returns `-1`.\n4.  After passing the validation checks, it computes the polynomial kernel matrix `K` using the formula `(X @ Y.T) ** degree`, where `@` denotes matrix multiplication and `**` denotes element-wise exponentiation.\n5.  The resulting kernel matrix `K` is rounded to four decimal places using `np.round(K, 4)`.\n6.  Finally, the rounded kernel matrix is converted to a nested Python list using the `tolist()` method and returned.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `polynomial_kernel` function with sample input matrices `X` and `Y`, and a specified `degree`. The result is printed to the console."}

{"task_id": 189, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "# Problem Understanding\nThe task is to implement a function `batch_resample` that resamples a batch of images stored in a 4-D NumPy array `X` to a new spatial resolution `(out_rows, out_cols)`. The input array `X` has a shape of `(n_ex, in_rows, in_cols, in_channels)`, and the output should have a shape of `(n_ex, out_rows, out_cols, in_channels)`.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- The input array `X` is a 4-D NumPy array.\n- The target dimension `new_dim` is a tuple of two integers `(out_rows, out_cols)`.\n- The interpolation mode `mode` can be either 'bilinear' or 'neighbor'.\n- If `mode` is anything except 'bilinear' or 'neighbor', a `NotImplementedError` should be raised with the message \"Unrecognized resampling mode: <mode>\".\n- The output elements should be rounded to the nearest 4th decimal place.\n\nInput: A 4-D NumPy array `X`, a tuple `new_dim`, and an optional string `mode`.\nOutput: A 4-D NumPy array with the resampled batch of images.\n\nSubtle requirements:\n- The batch and channel dimensions should remain in the same order in the output.\n- The output elements should be rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\n# Key Insights\n- The task involves resampling a batch of images to a new spatial resolution.\n- The `scipy.ndimage` module has functions that can perform interpolation, specifically `zoom` function.\n- However, instead of directly using `scipy.ndimage.zoom`, it's more straightforward to use a library that can handle the interpolation directly for the given task, such as `scipy.interpolate` or a dedicated image processing library.\n- A more suitable approach involves using `scipy.interpolate` to perform the interpolation or leveraging a library like `skimage.transform` which has a `resize` function that can handle the task.\n- The `skimage.transform.resize` function can resize an image to a new shape with different interpolation methods.\n- The interpolation mode 'bilinear' corresponds to `order=1` in `scipy.ndimage.zoom`, and 'neighbor' corresponds to `order=0`.\n- To apply the resampling to a batch of images, we need to iterate over each image in the batch and possibly over each channel.\n- The `map_coordinates` function from `scipy.ndimage` can be used for interpolation, but it's more complex to use directly for this task.\n- The output should be rounded to 4 decimal places, which can be achieved using `np.round`.\n\n## Key Steps:\n1. Check if the `mode` is valid. If not, raise a `NotImplementedError`.\n2. Iterate over each image in the batch and each channel.\n3. For each image and channel, perform the resampling using an appropriate interpolation method based on `mode`.\n4. Use `skimage.transform.resize` to resize each image channel to the new dimension with the specified interpolation mode.\n5. Round the output to 4 decimal places using `np.round`.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n1. Import necessary libraries: `numpy` and `skimage.transform`.\n2. Define the function `batch_resample` with the given signature.\n3. Check if `mode` is valid. If it's not 'bilinear' or 'neighbor', raise a `NotImplementedError`.\n4. Map 'bilinear' to `order=1` and 'neighbor' to `order=0` for `scipy.ndimage.zoom` or use the corresponding interpolation method in `skimage.transform.resize`.\n5. Iterate over each image in the batch and each channel. For each, resize the image to the new dimension using `skimage.transform.resize` with the appropriate interpolation method.\n6. For 'bilinear', use `skimage.transform.resize` with `order=1`. For 'neighbor', use `order=0`.\n7. Store the resized images in a new array with the correct shape `(n_ex, out_rows, out_cols, in_channels)`.\n8. Round the elements of the output array to 4 decimal places using `np.round`.\n9. Return the resampled batch of images.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom skimage.transform import resize\n\ndef batch_resample(X, new_dim, mode=\"bilinear\"):\n    out_rows, out_cols = new_dim\n    n_ex, in_rows, in_cols, in_channels = X.shape\n    Y = np.zeros((n_ex, out_rows, out_cols, in_channels))\n    \n    if mode not in [\"bilinear\", \"neighbor\"]:\n        raise NotImplementedError(f\"Unrecognized resampling mode: {mode}\")\n    \n    order = 1 if mode == \"bilinear\" else 0\n    \n    for i in range(n_ex):\n        for c in range(in_channels):\n            Y[i, :, :, c] = resize(X[i, :, :, c], (out_rows, out_cols), order=order, mode='reflect')\n    \n    return np.round(Y, 4)\n```"}

It first checks if the `name` is one of the supported metrics. If not, it returns a lambda function that always returns -1.\n*   The code defines four distance functions (`euclidean`, `manhattan`, `chebyshev`, `cosine`) and maps them to the corresponding metric names using a dictionary `distance_functions`.\n*   A validation function `validate` checks if the input vectors `x` and `y` are valid (i.e., they are lists, tuples, or NumPy arrays that can be converted to float, are one-dimensional, non-empty, and have the same length).\n*   The `validated_distance` function returned by the `metric` factory checks the validity of the input vectors using the `validate` function and computes the distance using the selected distance function. If the validation fails or if the metric is 'cosine' and either of the vectors has a zero norm, it returns -1."}

It then enters a loop where it attempts to reduce the total clustering cost by swapping any current medoid with any non-medoid sample.\n*   The `calculate_cost` function is used to compute the total cost, which is the sum of the Euclidean distances between every sample and the medoid of the cluster it belongs to.\n*   The algorithm iterates through all possible swaps between a medoid and a non-medoid sample, and it accepts the swap that results in the largest reduction in the total cost. This process continues until no swap can further decrease the cost.\n*   Finally, the function assigns each sample to the closest medoid based on the final set of medoids obtained after convergence and returns the cluster labels as a Python list."}

We will use `np.asarray()` for this conversion to handle various input types.\n2. Iterate through the NumPy array to check each element.

Ensure the function handles edge cases, such as an empty input sequence, and returns `0` as required.\n6. To handle potential errors when applying `np.isnan()` to non-numeric types, we will iterate through the original data and check each element individually, applying `np.isnan()` only when the element is not `None` and is of a type that could potentially be `NaN` (i.e., float or a NumPy float type).\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef num_missing(data) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count missing values in a 1-D iterable.\n\n    An element is missing if it is ``None`` or ``NaN``.\n\n    Args:\n        data: Any 1-D iterable (list, tuple, NumPy array, etc.).\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of missing elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    data_array = np.asarray(data, dtype=object)  # Convert to NumPy array with object dtype to handle mixed types\n    for element in data_array:\n        if element is None:\n            count += 1\n        elif isinstance(element, (float, np.floating)) and np.isnan(element):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```"}

The `squared_log_error` function calculates the element-wise squared logarithmic errors between the `actual` and `predicted` values. It uses NumPy's `log1p` function to compute `log(1 + x)`, which is more numerically stable than computing `log(1 + x)` directly.\n2.  The `mean_squared_log_error` function first validates the inputs by checking if they have the same shape/length and contain only non-negative values. If the inputs are invalid, it returns -1.\n3.  If the inputs are valid, it calls the `squared_log_error` function to calculate the element-wise squared logarithmic errors and then computes the mean of these errors using NumPy's `mean` function.\n4.

Each row must contain exactly one `1`.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- The input is a NumPy array.\n- The function should return `True` if the array is a valid one-hot matrix and `False` otherwise.\n- The function should not raise any exceptions.\n- The output should be exactly the Python boolean value `True` or `False`.\n\nInput: A NumPy array (`x: np.ndarray`).\nOutput: A boolean value (`bool`) indicating whether the input array is a valid one-hot matrix.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n- The function should handle NumPy arrays of any size and shape, not just specific examples.\n- The checks should be performed in a way that is efficient for NumPy arrays.\n\n# Key Insights\nCrucial observations that lead to the solution:\n1. To check if the array is two-dimensional, we can verify its shape has exactly two dimensions using the `len()` function on the shape attribute of the NumPy array.\n2. To check if every element is either `0` or `1`, we can use NumPy's capabilities to check if all elements are within the set `{0, 1}`. This can be done by checking if `(x == 0) | (x == 1)` is `True` for all elements, or more directly, by verifying that `x` is binary by checking if it is either `0` or `1` using `np.all((x == 0) | (x == 1))`.\n3. To check if each row contains exactly one `1`, we can sum the elements along each row (axis=1) and verify that the sum is exactly `1` for all rows. This can be achieved using `np.sum(x, axis=1)` and then checking if all sums are `1` using `np.all(np.sum(x, axis=1) == 1)`.\n\nPatterns or properties being used:\n- The properties of NumPy arrays, such as the ability to perform element-wise operations and aggregate operations along specific axes.\n- The fact that in a valid one-hot encoding, each row sums up to `1` because it contains exactly one `1`.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n- The example given in the task, `x = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]])`, which is a valid one-hot matrix.\n\n# Solution Strategy\nSteps to solve this problem:\n1.

For Aces 'A', increment the count of Aces and add 11 to the total score initially.\n6. After iterating through all cards, check if the total score exceeds 21.\n7.

{"task_id": 240, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the requirements\nThe task is to create a function `create_encoding_dicts` that generates four dictionaries: `obs2num`, `num2obs`, `act2num`, and `num2act`. These dictionaries map observation and action identifiers to unique integers and vice versa. The function takes in two lists, `obs_ids` and `action_ids`, and optionally two pre-defined encoders, `obs_encoder` and `act_encoder`.\n\n## Step 2: Determine how to create the `obs2num` dictionary\nTo create `obs2num`, we need to check if `obs_encoder` is provided. If it is, we use it directly. If not, we need to create the mapping by enumerating the identifiers in `obs_ids`. If `obs_ids` is empty and no `obs_encoder` is provided, `obs2num` should be empty.\n\n## Step 3: Implement the creation of `obs2num`\nWe will use a dictionary comprehension to create `obs2num` if `obs_encoder` is not provided. The comprehension will iterate over `obs_ids` with their indices to create the mapping.\n\n## Step 4: Determine how to create the `num2obs` dictionary\n`num2obs` is the inverse of `obs2num`. We can create it by swapping the key-value pairs of `obs2num`. This ensures that `num2obs[obs2num[x]] == x` for every observation identifier `x`.\n\n## Step 5: Implement the creation of `num2obs`\nWe will use a dictionary comprehension to swap the key-value pairs of `obs2num` to create `num2obs`.\n\n## Step 6: Determine how to create the `act2num` dictionary\nSimilar to `obs2num`, to create `act2num`, we check if `act_encoder` is provided. If it is, we use it. If not, we enumerate the identifiers in `action_ids` to create the mapping. If `action_ids` is empty and no `act_encoder` is provided, `act2num` should be empty.\n\n## Step 7: Implement the creation of `act2num`\nWe will use a similar approach as for `obs2num` to create `act2num`, checking for `act_encoder` and using `action_ids` if necessary.\n\n## Step 8: Determine how to create the `num2act` dictionary\n`num2act` is the inverse of `act2num`, created by swapping the key-value pairs of `act2num`.\n\n## Step 9: Implement the creation of `num2act`\nSimilar to `num2obs`, we will swap the key-value pairs of `act2num` to create `num2act`.\n\n## Step 10: Combine the results into a single dictionary\nThe function should return a dictionary containing `obs2num`, `num2obs`, `act2num`, and `num2act`.\n\n## Step 11: Write the Python code to implement these steps\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ndef create_encoding_dicts(obs_ids: list, action_ids: list,\n                          obs_encoder: dict | None = None,\n                          act_encoder: dict | None = None) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Generate forward and backward mappings for observations and actions.\n\n    Args:\n        obs_ids (list): All distinct observation identifiers.\n        action_ids (list): All distinct action identifiers.\n        obs_encoder (dict | None, optional): Existing obs\u2192number mapping.\n        act_encoder (dict | None, optional): Existing act\u2192number mapping.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary that contains the keys 'obs2num', 'num2obs',\n        'act2num', and 'num2act'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create obs2num dictionary\n    if obs_encoder is not None:\n        obs2num = obs_encoder\n    else:\n        obs2num = {obs: i for i, obs in enumerate(obs_ids)}\n\n    # Create num2obs dictionary as the inverse of obs2num\n    num2obs = {v: k for k, v in obs2num.items()}\n\n    # Create act2num dictionary\n    if act_encoder is not None:\n        act2num = act_encoder\n    else:\n        act2num = {act: i for i, act in enumerate(action_ids)}\n\n    # Create num2act dictionary as the inverse of act2num\n    num2act = {v: k for k, v in act2num.items()}\n\n    # Return the four dictionaries in a single dictionary\n    return {\n        'obs2num': obs2num,\n        'num2obs': num2obs,\n        'act2num': act2num,\n        'num2act': num2act\n    }\n```\n\n## Step 12: Test the function with an example\nTo ensure the function works as expected, we can test it with the provided example:\n```python\nobs_ids = ['left', 'right', 'front', 'back']\naction_ids = ['move', 'turn']\nresult = create_encoding_dicts(obs_ids, action_ids)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis should output:\n```python\n{\n  'obs2num':  {'left': 0, 'right': 1, 'front': 2, 'back': 3},\n  'num2obs':  {0: 'left', 1: 'right', 2: 'front', 3: 'back'},\n  'act2num':  {'move': 0, 'turn': 1},\n  'num2act':  {0: 'move', 1: 'turn'}\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is: \n```python\nimport numpy as np\ndef create_encoding_dicts(obs_ids: list, action_ids: list,\n                          obs_encoder: dict | None = None,\n                          act_encoder: dict | None = None) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Generate forward and backward mappings for observations and actions.\n\n    Args:\n        obs_ids (list): All distinct observation identifiers.\n        action_ids (list): All distinct action identifiers.\n        obs_encoder (dict | None, optional): Existing obs\u2192number mapping.\n        act_encoder (dict | None, optional): Existing act\u2192number mapping.\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary that contains the keys 'obs2num', 'num2obs',\n        'act2num', and 'num2act'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create obs2num dictionary\n    if obs_encoder is not None:\n        obs2num = obs_encoder\n    else:\n        obs2num = {obs: i for i, obs in enumerate(obs_ids)}\n\n    # Create num2obs dictionary as the inverse of obs2num\n    num2obs = {v: k for k, v in obs2num.items()}\n\n    # Create act2num dictionary\n    if act_encoder is not None:\n        act2num = act_encoder\n    else:\n        act2num = {act: i for i, act in enumerate(action_ids)}\n\n    # Create num2act dictionary as the inverse of act2num\n    num2act = {v: k for k, v in act2num.items()}\n\n    # Return the four dictionaries in a single dictionary\n    return {\n        'obs2num': obs2num,\n        'num2obs': num2obs,\n        'act2num': act2num,\n        'num2act': num2act\n    }\n```"}

The function first checks if the input `shape` has at least 2 dimensions. If not, it returns `-1`.\n2.  It then creates a 2-D matrix `A` with shape `(d0, d1*...*dn)` filled with i.i.d. samples from the standard normal distribution using `np.random.normal`.\n3.  The SVD of `A` is computed using `np.linalg.svd` with `full_matrices=False` to obtain the matrices `U`, `\u03a3`, and `V\u1d40`. The `full_matrices=False` argument ensures that `U` and `V\u1d40` are the correct shapes for the subsequent steps.\n4.  The function then chooses the SVD factor that has the same size as `A` by comparing the shapes of `U` and `A`. If they match, it assigns `U` to `Q`; otherwise, it assigns `V\u1d40` to `Q`.\n5.  `Q` is then reshaped back to the original `shape` using `np.reshape` and scaled by the given `scale` factor.\n6.  Finally, the function returns the resulting tensor as a Python list using the `tolist` method.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\nnp.random.seed(0)\nshape = (2, 2)\nscale = 0.5\nresult = orthogonal(shape, scale)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```python\n[[0.2590445471197694, 0.4261624821452039], [0.4261624821452039, -0.2600368879865514]]\n```"}

It uses a dictionary (`activations`) to map activation function names to their corresponding implementations. If the requested name is not found in the dictionary, it raises a `ValueError`.\n*   The `_to_numpy_array` function ensures that the input is converted to a 1-D NumPy array, handling various input types such as scalars, lists, tuples, and NumPy arrays. It also checks if the input is a NumPy array with more than one dimension and raises a `ValueError` in such cases.\n*   The `_round_result` function rounds the result of the activation function to 4 decimal places and maintains the original input structure (scalar or 1-D array/list)."}

If multiple arms share the same maximal reward after rounding, the function should return the smallest index.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- The input matrices `context` and `thetas` are numpy arrays of shape `(D, K)`, where `D` is the dimension of the context vector and `K` is the number of arms.\n- The expected reward of arm `k` is given by the inner product of the context vector `x_k` and the parameter vector `\u03b8_k`.\n- The function should return a tuple containing the best reward and the index of the best arm.\n- The best reward should be rounded to four decimal places.\n- If multiple arms share the same maximal reward after rounding, the function should return the smallest index.\n\nInput: `context` (numpy array of shape `(D, K)`), `thetas` (numpy array of shape `(D, K)`)\nOutput: Tuple containing `(best_reward, best_arm)`\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n- The function should be able to handle cases where multiple arms have the same maximal reward after rounding.\n\n# Key Insights\n- The expected reward for each arm `k` can be calculated as the dot product of the context vector `x_k` and the parameter vector `\u03b8_k`.\n- The context vectors `x_k` are the columns of the `context` matrix, and the parameter vectors `\u03b8_k` are the columns of the `thetas` matrix.\n- To find the maximal expected reward, we need to compute the expected reward for each arm and then find the maximum value.\n- We can use numpy's vectorized operations to efficiently compute the expected rewards for all arms.\n- The diagonal of the matrix product `X^T \u0398` gives the expected rewards for each arm, but since `X` and `\u0398` are matrices where columns represent arms, we actually need to compute the dot product of each column of `X` with the corresponding column of `\u0398`.\n- Numpy's `sum` function with `axis=0` can be used to compute the dot products for each arm.\n- The `argmax` function can be used to find the index of the arm with the maximal expected reward.\n- Rounding the maximal expected reward to four decimal places is necessary to meet the output requirements.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n- The example given in the problem statement, where `context = np.array([[0.5, 1.0], [1.5, 0.2]])` and `thetas = np.array([[0.1, 0.3], [0.4, 0.2]])`, helps illustrate the calculation of expected rewards and the determination of the best arm.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n1.

We start by ensuring that both `x` and `y` are at least 2D using `np.atleast_2d()`. This reshapes 1D arrays into row vectors (2D arrays with one row).\n   \n2. We then check if the feature dimensions (the second dimension) of `x` and `y` are the same. If they are not, we return -1 as per the problem statement.\n\n3. If the feature dimensions match, we compute the linear kernel (Gram matrix) by calculating the matrix product of `x` and the transpose of `y` using the `@` operator, which is the matrix multiplication operator in Python.\n\n4. Finally, we convert the resulting kernel matrix to a Python list of lists using the `tolist()` method and return it.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\nx = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\ny = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\nprint(linear_kernel(x, y))  # Output: [[17, 23], [39, 53]]\n\n# Test with 1D arrays\nx_1d = np.array([1, 2])\ny_1d = np.array([3, 2])\nprint(linear_kernel(x_1d, y_1d))  # Output: [[7]]\n\n# Test with mismatched feature dimensions\nx_mismatch = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\ny_mismatch = np.array([[7, 8], [9, 10]])\nprint(linear_kernel(x_mismatch, y_mismatch))  # Output: -1\n```"}

The function `format_entries` takes a list of tuples `entries` as input.\n2.

The formatted strings are collected in a list `formatted_entries`.\n4. The `'\\n'.join(formatted_entries)` expression concatenates all the formatted strings into a single string, separating them with a newline character (`\\n`).\n5. If `entries` is empty, `formatted_entries` will also be empty, and `'\\n'.join(formatted_entries)` will return an empty string, satisfying the condition for an empty input.\n\n#### Example Usage\n\n```python\nentries = [(\"username\", \"john_doe\"), (\"password\", \"s3cr3t\")]\nprint(format_entries(entries))\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nusername: \"john_doe\"\npassword: \"s3cr3t\"\n```\n\nThis code adheres to the given constraints and example output. It correctly handles the case where `entries` is empty by returning an empty string.

Compute the minimum and maximum values for each feature column using NumPy's `min` and `max` functions.\n3. Apply the Min-Max scaling formula to each feature column using NumPy's vectorized operations.\n4. Handle constant feature columns by adjusting the scaling accordingly.\n5. Replace `nan`, `inf`, or `-inf` values with `0.0` during the computation.\n\n# Solution Strategy\nSteps to solve this problem:\n1. Check if the `feature_range` is valid (i.e., `a < b`). If not, return `-1`.\n2. Convert the input data to a NumPy array.\n3. Compute the minimum and maximum values for each feature column using NumPy's `min` and `max` functions with `axis=0`.\n4.

The function `k_means` takes a 2-D NumPy array `X`, an integer `k`, and an optional `max_iterations` parameter.\n2.  It initializes the centroids with the first `k` samples of `X`.\n3.  The algorithm iterates until convergence or until `max_iterations` is reached.\n4.  In each iteration, it assigns each sample to the closest centroid by computing the Euclidean distance between each sample and the centroids.\n5.  It then recomputes the centroids as the mean of all samples assigned to each cluster. If a cluster becomes empty, its centroid remains unchanged.\n6.  The algorithm checks for convergence by comparing the new centroids with the previous ones. If they are the same, it stops.\n7.  Finally, it returns the final cluster indices as a list.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nThe code includes an example usage in the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, where it generates random data, performs K-Means clustering, and prints the resulting cluster indices."}

The function should use a binary heap to achieve the required time and space complexity.\n2. The returned list should be sorted according to the chosen order.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n1. To solve this problem, we need to use a binary heap data structure, which is available in Python's `heapq` module.\n2. We need to handle two cases based on the `order` parameter: `largest` and `smallest`.\n3. For `order == largest`, we need to keep track of the k largest elements seen so far. A min-heap can be used for this purpose, where the smallest element is always at the top.\n4. For `order == smallest`, we need to keep track of the k smallest elements seen so far. A max-heap can be used for this purpose, but since Python's `heapq` module only provides a min-heap, we can use a min-heap with negation to simulate a max-heap.\n5. We need to iterate through the input list, pushing elements onto the heap and popping the smallest/largest element when the heap size exceeds k.\n6. After iterating through the entire list, the heap will contain the k largest/smallest elements.\n7. We need to return the elements in the heap in the correct order, which requires sorting or reversing the output depending on the `order` parameter.\n8. Edge cases such as `k <= 0`, `k >= len(sequence)`, and an empty input list need to be handled correctly.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Check if `k` is less than or equal to 0 or the input list is empty. If so, return an empty list.\n2. Check if `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the input list. If so, return the entire list sorted according to the chosen order.\n3. Initialize a heap based on the `order` parameter. For `order == largest`, use a min-heap. For `order == smallest`, use a min-heap with negation to simulate a max-heap.\n4. Iterate through the input list, pushing elements onto the heap and popping the smallest/largest element when the heap size exceeds k.\n5. After iterating through the entire list, the heap will contain the k largest/smallest elements.\n6. Return the elements in the heap in the correct order. For `order == largest`, return the elements in non-increasing order. For `order == smallest`, return the elements in non-decreasing order.\n7. Use the `heapq` module to implement the binary heap operations.\n8.

The function takes four inputs:\n- `params`: a list of 2-tuples where each tuple contains a prediction made by the program and a label.\n- `golds`: a dictionary that maps every possible label to the expected (gold) text.\n- `ix`: an integer index pointing to the item in `params` for which a detailed comparison is to be made.\n- `warn_str`: an optional extra message to be appended to the report.\n\nThe function should return a string with a specific format that includes a header, the previous and current predictions and gold values, the warning string (if any), and a footer.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- The format of the output string is strictly defined.\n- The index `ix` might be 0, in which case the \"previous\" item is also the item at index 0.\n- The `warn_str` is optional and defaults to an empty string.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n1. **Understanding the required format**: The output string has a specific format that includes a header, comparisons of previous and current predictions and gold values, and a footer.\n2. **Identifying the previous index**: The previous index is `max(ix - 1, 0)`, ensuring it doesn't go out of bounds when `ix` is 0.\n3. **Accessing `params` and `golds`**: The function needs to access elements in `params` using `ix` and the previous index, and use the labels from `params` to get the corresponding gold values from `golds`.\n4. **Handling the optional `warn_str`**: The function should append `warn_str` to the report before the footer.\n5. **Constructing the output string**: The output string needs to be constructed with the exact required format, including newlines and dashes.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. **Calculate the previous index**: Determine the previous index using `max(ix - 1, 0)`.\n2. **Retrieve previous and current predictions and labels**: Use `ix` and the previous index to get the corresponding elements from `params`.\n3. **Get the gold values for the previous and current labels**: Use the labels from `params` to retrieve the gold values from `golds`.\n4. **Construct the header**: Create the header line with 25 dashes, the word \"DEBUG\", and another 25 dashes, followed by a newline.\n5. **Format the previous and current comparisons**: Create the comparison blocks for the previous and current predictions and gold values, following the specified format.\n6. **Append the warning string (if any)**: Add `warn_str` to the report before the footer.\n7. **Construct the footer**: Create the footer line with 23 dashes, the text \"END DEBUG\", and another 23 dashes.\n8. **Combine all parts into the final output string**: Ensure the output string follows the exact required format.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Dict\n\ndef err_fmt(params: List[Tuple[str, str]],\n            golds: Dict[str, str],\n            ix: int,\n            warn_str: str = \"\") -> str:\n    \"\"\"Return a formatted multi-line debug string comparing predictions to golds.\n\n    See the task description for the exact required format.\n\n    Args:\n        params: A list where every element is a tuple (prediction, label).\n        golds:  A dictionary mapping each label to its gold/expected string.\n        ix:     The index inside `params` for which the detailed comparison\n                 is built.\n        warn_str: Optional extra text appended before the footer.\n\n    Returns:\n        A string that follows the specified layout exactly.\n    \"\"\"\n    prev_ix = max(ix - 1, 0)\n    prev_prediction, prev_label = params[prev_ix]\n    prev_gold = golds[prev_label]\n    curr_prediction, curr_label = params[ix]\n    curr_gold = golds[curr_label]\n\n    header = \"------------------------- DEBUG -------------------------\\n\"\n    prev_block = f\"Mine (prev) [{prev_label}]:\\n{prev_prediction}\\n\\nTheirs (prev) [{prev_label}]:\\n{prev_gold}\\n\\n\"\n    curr_block = f\"Mine [{curr_label}]:\\n{curr_prediction}\\n\\nTheirs [{curr_label}]:\\n{curr_gold}{warn_str}\\n\"\n    footer = \"----------------------- END DEBUG -----------------------\"\n\n    report = header + prev_block + curr_block + footer\n    return report\n```"}

If not, it returns an empty list.\n*   It then clips the `x` and `y` coordinates to be within the valid range of the image using `np.clip`. This ensures that the coordinates are not outside the image boundaries.\n*   The function computes the integer part and the fractional part of the clipped coordinates using `np.floor` and subtraction. These values are used to perform bilinear interpolation.\n*   For each coordinate, it computes the interpolated value by calculating the weighted sum of the four neighboring pixels. The weights are determined by the fractional parts of the coordinates. The interpolated values are rounded to 4 decimal places using `round(4)` and converted to a list using `tolist()`. The final result is a list of lists, where each inner list contains the interpolated values for a pixel."}

The function should receive the critic scores for fake samples, know for which network the loss should be computed, and if computing the critic loss, also receive the critic scores for real samples and the gradients of the critic output with respect to the interpolated samples.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- The function should be able to compute the loss for either the critic (module == C) or the generator (module == G).\n- For the critic loss, it requires critic scores for both fake and real samples (Y_fake and Y_real) and the gradients of the critic output with respect to the interpolated samples (gradInterp).\n- If the critic loss is requested but Y_real or gradInterp is None, the function should raise a ValueError.\n- The function should return the corresponding scalar loss rounded to four decimal places.\n- The gradient-penalty coefficient \u03bb (lambda_) should be a non-negative float, defaulting to 10.0 if not provided.\n\nInput:\n- Y_fake: Critic scores for fake samples (np.ndarray)\n- module: Indicates whether to compute the loss for the critic (C) or the generator (G) (str)\n- Y_real: Critic scores for real samples (np.ndarray | None), required for critic loss\n- gradInterp: Gradients of the critic output with respect to the interpolated samples (np.ndarray | None), required for critic loss\n- lambda_: Gradient-penalty coefficient (float), defaults to 10.0\n\nOutput:\n- The requested loss rounded to four decimal places (float)\n\n# Key Insights\n- The critic loss (L_C) is calculated using the formula: E_{x_fake}[D(x_fake)] - E_{x_real}[D(x_real)] + \u03bb \u00b7 E_{x_interp}[(\u2016\u2207_{x_interp}D(x_interp)\u2016\u2082 \u2212 1)\u00b2].\n- The generator loss (L_G) is calculated using the formula: \u2212E_{x_fake}[D(x_fake)].\n- To compute the critic loss, we need the critic scores for both fake and real samples, as well as the gradients of the critic output with respect to the interpolated samples.\n- The gradient penalty is calculated as the expectation of the squared difference between the L2 norm of the gradients of the critic output with respect to the interpolated samples and 1, multiplied by \u03bb.\n- The L2 norm of the gradients is computed as the square root of the sum of the squares of the gradient elements.\n- The expectations are computed as the mean of the respective values over the mini-batch.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n1. Check if the module is 'C' (critic) or 'G' (generator). If it's neither, the function should implicitly return or handle this case, but the problem doesn't specify this, so we'll assume it will be either 'C' or 'G'.\n\n2. If the module is 'G', compute the generator loss L_G = \u2212E_{x_fake}[D(x_fake)] by taking the negative mean of Y_fake.\n\n3. If the module is 'C', check if Y_real and gradInterp are not None. If either is None, raise a ValueError because both are required for the critic loss.\n\n4. For the critic loss, compute E_{x_fake}[D(x_fake)] as the mean of Y_fake and E_{x_real}[D(x_real)] as the mean of Y_real.\n\n5. Compute the gradient penalty by first calculating the L2 norm of gradInterp, then subtracting 1, squaring the result, and finally taking the mean of these squared values and multiplying by \u03bb.\n\n6.

If either condition is not met, it immediately returns `False`.\n\n2. **Symmetry Check**: It then checks if `X` is symmetric by comparing it with its transpose `X.T` using `np.allclose` with a tolerance of `1e-8`. If `X` is not symmetric within this tolerance, the function returns `False`.\n\n3. **Positive-Definiteness Check**: If `X` is symmetric, the function computes its eigenvalues using `np.linalg.eigvalsh`, which is efficient for symmetric matrices. It checks if all eigenvalues are greater than `1e-8`. If any eigenvalue is not positive (within the tolerance), the function returns `False`.\n\n4. **Result**: If `X` passes both checks, the function returns `True`, indicating that `X` is symmetric and positive-definite.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example 1: A symmetric positive-definite matrix\nX = np.array([[2, 1], [1, 2]])\nprint(is_symmetric_positive_definite(X))  # Expected output: True\n\n# Example 2: A non-symmetric matrix\nY = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\nprint(is_symmetric_positive_definite(Y))  # Expected output: False\n\n# Example 3: A symmetric but not positive-definite matrix\nZ = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\nprint(is_symmetric_positive_definite(Z))  # Expected output: False\n```"}

The function `kmeans` takes in a 2-D NumPy array `data`, an integer `K`, and an optional integer `max_iters`.\n2.  It first checks if `K` equals 1. If so, it returns a list containing the mean of the entire dataset as the single centroid.\n3.  The function initializes the `K` centroids with the first `K` samples in the `data` matrix.\n4.  It then enters a loop that runs for at most `max_iters` iterations.\n5.  Inside the loop, it calculates the Euclidean distance between each sample and the centroids, assigning each sample to the closest centroid.\n6.  The centroids are then recomputed as the mean of the samples currently assigned to them. If a centroid loses all its samples, it remains unchanged.\n7.  The loop checks for convergence by comparing the old and new centroids. If the difference is within a tolerance of 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076, the loop breaks.\n8.  After the loop, the function sorts the final centroids lexicographically, rounds every coordinate to four decimals, and returns them as a plain Python list of lists.\n\n**Output**\n\nFor the given example, the output will be:\n\n```python\n[[1.3333, 1.3333], [8.3333, 8.3333]]\n```"}

The function should also be able to return the analytical gradient of the loss with respect to the soft-max output when `derivative=True`. The loss is calculated as the sum over all samples, not the mean.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the formula for cross-entropy loss\nThe cross-entropy loss is given by $L = \u2212\u2211_{i=1..n} \u2211_{j=1..m} y_{ij} \u00b7 log( y\u0302_{ij} + eps )$, where $y$ is the one-hot encoded true labels, $\u0177$ (or `y_pred`) is the predicted class probabilities, $n$ is the number of samples, $m$ is the number of classes, and $eps$ is a small positive constant to avoid numerical issues with $log(0)$.\n\n## Step 3: Implement the cross-entropy loss calculation\nTo calculate the loss, we first need to compute $log(\u0177 + eps)$ and then perform the double summation. Since $y$ is one-hot encoded, the loss simplifies to $L = \u2212\u2211_{i=1..n} log(\u0177_{ij(i)} + eps)$, where $j(i)$ is the index of the true class for sample $i$.

We stack these arrays into a single NumPy array `updates_array` along a new axis using `np.stack(updates, axis=-1)`. This allows us to perform vectorized operations on all updates simultaneously.\n\n2. **Calculating Scaled Updates Sum**: We calculate the sum of the updates scaled by the `learning_rate`. This is done by multiplying `updates_array` with `learning_rate` and then summing along the last axis (`axis=-1`) using `np.sum(updates_array * learning_rate, axis=-1)`.\n\n3. **Initializing Running Prediction**: The `running_pred` is initialized as the negative of the `scaled_updates_sum`. This is because the problem states that each tree's output is subtracted from the running prediction.\n\n4. **Regression**: If `regression` is `True`, we simply return `running_pred` rounded to 4 decimal places using `np.round(running_pred, 4)`.\n\n5. **Classification**: If `regression` is `False`, we perform the following steps:\n   - Apply the softmax function to `running_pred` to obtain class probabilities. We first subtract the maximum value along the last axis (`axis=-1`) to prevent overflow.\n   - Calculate the predicted class labels by taking the argmax of the probabilities along the last axis (`axis=-1`) using `np.argmax(probabilities, axis=-1)`.\n\n6. **Return**: The function returns the predicted values. For regression, it's a 1-D array of floats rounded to 4 decimals. For classification, it's a 1-D array of integers representing the predicted class labels."}

This array represents the column indices where the value 1 should be placed in each row of the one-hot matrix.\n* We then create the one-hot encoded matrix `one_hot_matrix` by indexing into an identity matrix of size `n_classes` using `np.eye(n_classes)` and the generated `random_class_indices`. This effectively creates a matrix where each row is a one-hot encoded vector corresponding to the randomly chosen class indices.\n* The function returns `one_hot_matrix`, which is a NumPy `ndarray` of shape `(n_examples, n_classes)` where every row is a valid one-hot vector chosen uniformly at random from the `n_classes` possible class indices.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\nprint(random_one_hot_matrix(5, 3))\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[[1. 0. 0.]\n [0. 1. 0.]\n [1. 0. 0.]\n [0. 1. 0.]\n [0. 1. 0.]]\n```"}

This allows for vectorized operations on the input data.\n* It then uses an if-elif-else structure to determine which activation function to apply based on the `param` argument. For each supported activation function, it applies the corresponding mathematical operation to the input `x`.\n* For 'leaky relu' and 'affine' activations, it uses regular expressions to extract additional parameters (alpha for 'leaky relu', slope and intercept for 'affine') from the `param` string.\n* Finally, it rounds the result to 6 decimal places using `np.round(result, 6)` and returns it as a Python list using the `tolist()` method."}
{"task_id": 406, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "# Problem Understanding\nThe task is to implement the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) prediction algorithm. We are given a set of training samples (`X_train`) with their corresponding class labels (`y_train`) and an array of samples to be classified (`X_test`). We need to write a function that predicts the class of every test sample by majority voting among its *k* closest training samples, where closeness is measured with the Euclidean distance.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- `X_train` is a 2-D array with shape (n_train, n_features) containing the training data.\n- `y_train` is a 1-D array with length n_train containing the class labels of the training data. Labels have to be *non-negative* integers.\n- `X_test` is a 2-D array with shape (n_test, n_features) containing the test samples whose labels are to be predicted.\n- `k` is an integer representing the number of nearest neighbors to use for the majority vote. If `k` is larger than the number of training samples, we should use all available samples.\n- In case of a tie in the majority vote, we should choose the smallest label value.\n\nInput: `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, and `k`.\nOutput: A Python list with one predicted label per test sample.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n- We should use the Euclidean distance to measure the closeness between samples.\n- We should handle the case where `k` is larger than the number of training samples.\n\n# Key Insights\n- To solve this problem, we need to compute the Euclidean distance between each test sample and all training samples.\n- We can use the formula for Euclidean distance: $d = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n_features} (a_i - b_i)^2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are two vectors.\n- We can utilize NumPy's broadcasting to compute the distances between each test sample and all training samples efficiently.\n- After computing the distances, we need to select the indices of the *k* training samples with the smallest distances for each test sample.\n- We can use `np.argsort` to get the indices of the sorted distances.\n- We then retrieve the labels of these *k* nearest neighbors and count how many times each label appears.\n- We can use `np.bincount` to count the occurrences of each label, followed by `argmax` to find the label with the highest count. In case of a tie, `argmax` will return the smallest label value because `np.bincount` counts the occurrences in the order of the labels.\n- We need to repeat this process for every sample in `X_test` and return a Python list with the predicted labels in the original order of `X_test`.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n1. Compute the Euclidean distance between each test sample and all training samples using NumPy's broadcasting.\n2.

In case of a tie, `argmax` will return the smallest label value.\n6. Repeat the process for every sample in `X_test`.\n7.

The dictionary should contain the \"type\" of activation function and any associated numeric parameters as floats. If the input string does not match any valid pattern, the function should return -1.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the valid patterns for the activation functions\nThere are five valid forms for the activation function descriptions:\n1. \"ReLU\"\n2. \"Sigmoid\"\n3. \"Tanh\"\n4. \"Affine(slope=<number>, intercept=<number>)\"\n5. \"Leaky ReLU(alpha=<number>)\"\n\n## Step 3: Determine the regular expression patterns for each valid form\nTo parse these descriptions, we can use regular expressions. We need to define patterns that match each of the valid forms.\n\n## Step 4: Define the regular expression for the numeric value\nFirst, we define a pattern for a numeric value, which can be an integer or a floating-point number. The pattern for a number is: `-?\\d+(?:\\.\\d*)?|\\.\\d+`. This pattern matches an optional minus sign followed by either digits optionally followed by a decimal point and more digits, or a decimal point followed by digits.\n\n## Step 5: Create regular expressions for each activation function\n1.

The `RegressionTree` class represents a regression tree, and the `gbdt_regression` function implements the GBDT regressor.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  The `gbdt_regression` function initializes the predictions with the mean of `y_train`.\n2.  It iterates `n_estimators` times, computing the residuals (negative gradients of the squared-error loss) at each step.\n3.  A regression tree is fit to the residuals using the `RegressionTree` class.\n4.  The predictions for both the training data and the test data are updated using the regression tree's predictions and the learning rate.\n5.  Finally, the function returns the final predictions for the test data, rounded to 4 decimal places, as a Python list.\n\nThe `RegressionTree` class is a basic implementation of a regression tree. It includes methods for growing the tree, making predictions, and traversing the tree.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `gbdt_regression` function with random data."}

The function `dct2` takes a list of real numbers as input and returns a list of the same length containing the DCT-II coefficients.\n2. The input list is converted to a NumPy array `x` for efficient numerical computations.\n3. The length `N` of the input signal is obtained using `len(x)`.\n4. If `N` is 0, an empty list is returned immediately.\n5. The indices `n` and `k` are generated using `np.arange`, where `k` is reshaped to a column vector using `[:, None]`.\n6. The DCT-II coefficients `X` are calculated using the formula: `X = \u03a3\u2099\u208c\u2080^{N\u22121}  x\u2099 \u00b7 cos[ \u03c0/N \u00b7 (n + 0.5) \u00b7 k ]`. This is implemented using NumPy's vectorized operations.\n7. The coefficients are rounded to four decimal places using `np.round` and returned as a list using `tolist()`."}

The function `multivariate_gaussian_pdf` takes in three parameters: `X`, `mean`, and `cov`, representing the data points, mean vector, and covariance matrix, respectively.\n2.  It first checks if `X` is a one-dimensional array and reshapes it to a 2D array if necessary.\n3.  The determinant of the covariance matrix is calculated using `np.linalg.det`. If the determinant is zero, it indicates that the covariance matrix is singular, and a `ValueError` is raised.\n4.  The inverse of the covariance matrix is computed using `np.linalg.inv`.\n5.  The function then iterates over each data point in `X`, calculates the difference between the data point and the mean vector, and computes the exponent term using the inverse of the covariance matrix.\n6.  The PDF value is calculated using the formula for the multivariate Gaussian distribution, and the result is rounded to four decimal places and appended to the `pdf_values` list.\n7.  Finally, the function returns the list of PDF values.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `multivariate_gaussian_pdf` function to evaluate the PDF values for a set of data points given a mean vector and covariance matrix. The output is a list of PDF values rounded to four decimal places."}

The function `softplus` starts by converting the input `x` to a NumPy array to handle various input types uniformly.\n2.  It computes `e^x` using `np.exp(x)` and stores it in `exp_x` to avoid redundant calculations.\n3.  Based on the `order` parameter, it calculates either the SoftPlus function, its first derivative, or its second derivative using the formulas provided.\n4.  If `order` is not 0, 1, or 2, the function immediately returns `-1` as per the task requirements.\n5.  After calculating the desired value, it rounds the result to 4 decimal places using `np.round`.\n6.  Finally, it checks if the result is a scalar (i.e., `result.size == 1`). If so, it returns the value as a Python `float`; otherwise, it converts the NumPy array to a list using `tolist()` and returns the list.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\nprint(softplus(1.0, 0))  # SoftPlus(1.0)\nprint(softplus([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0))  # SoftPlus([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\nprint(softplus(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), 1))  # SoftPlus'([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\nprint(softplus((1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 2))  # SoftPlus''([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\nprint(softplus(1.0, 3))  # Invalid order, returns -1\n```"}

If `Y` is `None`, the function should compute the kernel matrix between `X` and itself.\n- `sigma` is a scale parameter that can be a single positive float, a list of positive floats of length `C` (where `C` is the number of features), or `None`.\n- If `sigma` is `None`, it should default to the square root of `C/2`, where `C` is the number of features in `X`.\n- The function should return `-1` if `sigma` is non-positive, if `sigma` is a list whose length does not match the number of features, or if the feature dimensions of `X` and `Y` do not match.\n- The output should be the kernel matrix rounded to 4 decimal places as a nested Python list.\n\nInput: `X`, `Y` (optional), `sigma` (optional)\nOutput: RBF kernel matrix as a nested list, or `-1` on invalid input\n\nSubtle requirements:\n- The function should handle both isotropic and anisotropic kernels based on the value of `sigma`.\n- The output should be rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\n# Key Insights\n- The RBF kernel between two vectors `x` and `y` is given by `k(x, y) = exp{-0.5 * \u03a3_j ((x_j \u2212 y_j)/\u03c3_j)^2}`, where `\u03c3` is the scale parameter.\n- If `sigma` is a single float, it is used for all features (isotropic kernel).\n- If `sigma` is a list of floats, each value is used for the corresponding feature (anisotropic kernel).\n- The default value of `sigma` when it is `None` is `\u221a(C/2)`, where `C` is the number of features.\n- To compute the kernel matrix, we need to calculate the squared Euclidean distance between each pair of vectors from `X` and `Y`, scale this distance by `sigma`, and then apply the exponential function.\n- The input validation is crucial to handle different edge cases, such as non-positive `sigma`, mismatched feature dimensions, and invalid `sigma` length.\n- The computation can be efficiently done using NumPy for vectorized operations.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n1. **Input Validation**:\n   - Convert `X` and `Y` (if provided) to NumPy arrays and check if their feature dimensions match.\n   - Validate `sigma`: check if it is positive (if a float), if its length matches the number of features (if a list), or set it to the default value (if `None`).\n   - Return `-1` for any invalid input.\n\n2. **Compute Default Sigma**:\n   - If `sigma` is `None`, compute the default value based on the number of features `C` as `\u221a(C/2)`.\n\n3. **Prepare Sigma for Computation**:\n   - If `sigma` is a single float, create an array of the same value repeated for each feature.\n   - If `sigma` is a list, convert it to a NumPy array.\n\n4. **Compute Kernel Matrix**:\n   - Iterate over each vector in `X` and `Y`, compute the squared Euclidean distance scaled by `sigma`, and apply the exponential function to get the kernel value.\n   - Store these values in a matrix.\n\n5. **Round and Return Result**:\n   - Round all entries in the kernel matrix to 4 decimal places.\n   - Return the result as a nested Python list. If `Y` is `None`, the result will be a square matrix.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef rbf_kernel(X: list[list[int | float]],\n               Y: list[list[int | float]] | None = None,\n               sigma: float | list[float] | None = None) -> list[list[float]]:\n    X = np.array(X)\n    if Y is not None:\n        Y = np.array(Y)\n        if X.shape[1] != Y.shape[1]:\n            return -1\n    else:\n        Y = X\n    \n    C = X.shape[1]\n    \n    if sigma is None:\n        sigma = np.sqrt(C / 2)\n    \n    if isinstance(sigma, float) or isinstance(sigma, int):\n        if sigma <= 0:\n            return -1\n        sigma_array = np.array([sigma] * C)\n    elif isinstance(sigma, list):\n        if len(sigma) != C:\n            return -1\n        sigma_array = np.array(sigma)\n        if np.any(sigma_array <= 0):\n            return -1\n    else:\n        return -1\n    \n    kernel_matrix = np.zeros((X.shape[0], Y.shape[0]))\n    for i in range(X.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(Y.shape[0]):\n            diff = X[i] - Y[j]\n            scaled_diff = diff / sigma_array\n            squared_distance = np.sum(scaled_diff ** 2)\n            kernel_matrix[i, j] = np.exp(-0.5 * squared_distance)\n    \n    kernel_matrix = np.round(kernel_matrix, 4).tolist()\n    return kernel_matrix\n```"}

If `Y` is not provided, the function should compute the correlation matrix of `X` with itself.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The input matrices `X` and `Y` are 2D NumPy arrays.\n- `X` and `Y` must have the same number of rows (samples).\n- If any column in `X` or `Y` has a zero standard deviation, the function should return `-1`.\n- The output correlation matrix should be rounded to four decimal places.\n- The output should be a regular Python list of lists.\n\nInput: Two 2D NumPy arrays `X` and `Y` (optional).\nOutput: A Python list of lists representing the correlation matrix, or `-1` if the computation is not possible.\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n- The function should use the population covariance and standard deviation formulas.\n- The output correlation values should be rounded to four decimal places.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n1. **Understanding the Pearson Correlation Coefficient**: The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two random variables. It is defined as the covariance between the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations.\n\n2. **Population Covariance and Standard Deviation**: The population covariance and standard deviation are used in the calculation. The covariance is calculated as the average of the product of the deviations from the mean for each variable. The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared deviations from the mean.\n\n3. **Handling Zero Standard Deviation**: If any column in `X` or `Y` has a zero standard deviation, the correlation is undefined, and the function should return `-1`.\n\n4. **Computing the Correlation Matrix**: To compute the correlation matrix, we need to calculate the covariance between each pair of columns from `X` and `Y`, as well as the standard deviations of each column. The correlation coefficient is then calculated using the formula $\\rho_{ij}=\\frac{\\operatorname{cov}(X_{:i},\\,Y_{:j})}{\\sigma_{X_i}\\,\\sigma_{Y_j}}$.\n\n5. **Rounding the Output**: The computed correlation coefficients should be rounded to four decimal places before being returned as a Python list of lists.\n\n6. **Implementation**: The function should first check if any column in `X` or `Y` has a zero standard deviation. Then, it should compute the correlation matrix using the formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient.

This function takes in training data `X_train` and `Y_train`, validation data `X_val` and `Y_val`, and an integer `k` as inputs. It predicts the labels of `X_val` using the k-NN algorithm with `X_train` and `Y_train`, and then returns the classification accuracy and the list of predicted labels.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the Euclidean distance between each validation sample and all training samples\nTo find the k nearest neighbours for each validation sample, we first need to calculate the Euclidean distance between each validation sample and all training samples. This can be achieved using NumPy's broadcasting feature.\n\n## Step 3: Implement the distance calculation\nThe distance between two sets of points `X_val` and `X_train` can be calculated as follows:\n```python\ndistances = np.sqrt(np.sum((X_val[:, np.newaxis, :] - X_train[np.newaxis, :, :]) ** 2, axis=-1))\n```\nThis gives us a matrix where `distances[i, j]` is the distance between the `i-th` validation sample and the `j-th` training sample.\n\n## Step 4: Find the indices of the k nearest neighbours for each validation sample\nWe use `np.argsort` to find the indices of the k nearest neighbours.\n```python\nk_nearest_indices = np.argsort(distances, axis=1)[:, :k]\n```\nThis gives us the indices of the k nearest training samples for each validation sample.\n\n## Step 5: Predict the labels of the validation samples using the majority vote of their k nearest neighbours\nFirst, we get the labels of the k nearest neighbours for each validation sample.\n```python\nk_nearest_labels = Y_train[k_nearest_indices]\n```\nThen, we count the occurrences of each label and find the most frequent one (or the smallest label if there's a tie).\n```python\npredicted_labels = np.array([np.argmax(np.bincount(labels)) for labels in k_nearest_labels])\n```\nThis gives us the predicted label for each validation sample.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the classification accuracy\nWe compare the predicted labels with the true labels `Y_val` to calculate the accuracy.\n```python\naccuracy = np.mean(predicted_labels == Y_val)\n```\nThen, we round this accuracy to 4 decimal places.\n```python\naccuracy = round(accuracy, 4)\n```\n\n## Step 7: Return the accuracy and the list of predicted labels\nFinally, we return the accuracy and the list of predicted labels as a tuple.\n\n## Step 8: Putting it all together into the `knn_validate` function\nHere's how the complete function looks:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef knn_validate(X_train: np.ndarray,\n                 Y_train: np.ndarray,\n                 X_val: np.ndarray,\n                 Y_val: np.ndarray,\n                 k: int) -> tuple[float, list[int]]:\n    # Calculate Euclidean distances between validation samples and training samples\n    distances = np.sqrt(np.sum((X_val[:, np.newaxis, :] - X_train[np.newaxis, :, :]) ** 2, axis=-1))\n    \n    # Find indices of k nearest neighbours for each validation sample\n    k_nearest_indices = np.argsort(distances, axis=1)[:, :k]\n    \n    # Get labels of k nearest neighbours\n    k_nearest_labels = Y_train[k_nearest_indices]\n    \n    # Predict labels using majority vote\n    predicted_labels = np.array([np.argmax(np.bincount(labels)) for labels in k_nearest_labels])\n    \n    # Calculate classification accuracy\n    accuracy = round(np.mean(predicted_labels == Y_val), 4)\n    \n    # Return accuracy and predicted labels\n    return accuracy, predicted_labels.tolist()\n```\n\nThe final answer is: \n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef knn_validate(X_train: np.ndarray,\n                 Y_train: np.ndarray,\n                 X_val: np.ndarray,\n                 Y_val: np.ndarray,\n                 k: int) -> tuple[float, list[int]]:\n    distances = np.sqrt(np.sum((X_val[:, np.newaxis, :] - X_train[np.newaxis, :, :]) ** 2, axis=-1))\n    k_nearest_indices = np.argsort(distances, axis=1)[:, :k]\n    k_nearest_labels = Y_train[k_nearest_indices]\n    predicted_labels = np.array([np.argmax(np.bincount(labels)) for labels in k_nearest_labels])\n    accuracy = round(np.mean(predicted_labels == Y_val), 4)\n    return accuracy, predicted_labels.tolist()\n```"}

It converts the inputs to NumPy arrays, checks if they have the same length, and raises a `ValueError` if not.\n*   The RBF kernel value is computed as `exp(-gamma * ||x1 - x2||^2)`, where `||x1 - x2||^2` is the Euclidean norm squared of the difference between `x1` and `x2`. This is implemented using NumPy operations.\n*   The result is rounded to four decimal places using the `round` function before being returned.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Create an RBF kernel function with gamma = 0.5\nrbf = rbf_kernel(gamma=0.5)\n\n# Compute the RBF similarity between two vectors\nx1 = [1, 2, 3]\nx2 = [4, 5, 6]\nsimilarity = rbf(x1, x2)\nprint(similarity)\n```"}

We define the `linear_kernel` function with a flexible signature that accepts any keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) and returns a callable.\n2.  Inside `linear_kernel`, we define an inner function `f(x1, x2)` that will be returned by the factory.\n3.  Within `f(x1, x2)`, we convert the input vectors `x1` and `x2` to NumPy arrays of `float` type using `np.asarray` with `dtype=float`. This ensures that the inputs are in a suitable format for numerical computations.\n4.  We check if the lengths of `x1` and `x2` are equal. If not, we immediately return `-1` as per the problem requirements.\n5.  If the vectors have the same length, we compute their dot product using `np.inner(x1, x2)`. The result is then explicitly converted to a Python `float` using the `float()` function to satisfy the output constraint.\n6.  Finally, the inner function `f(x1, x2)` is returned by the `linear_kernel` factory, allowing it to be used for computing the linear kernel between two input vectors.\n\nYou can test this code with example usage like this:\n\n```python\n# Create the linear kernel callable\nkernel_func = linear_kernel()\n\n# Test with two valid vectors\nx1 = [1, 2, 3]\nx2 = [4, 5, 6]\nresult = kernel_func(x1, x2)\nprint(result)  # Output: 32.0\n\n# Test with vectors of different lengths\nx1 = [1, 2, 3]\nx2 = [4, 5]\nresult = kernel_func(x1, x2)\nprint(result)  # Output: -1\n```"}

To get the canonical absolute path, we need to resolve symbolic links and remove any redundant path segments like .. or ..\n2. The `os.path.abspath` function can be used to get the absolute path, but it does not resolve symbolic links.\n3. To resolve symbolic links, we need to use `os.path.realpath`, but we are restricted from using it directly. Instead, we need to understand its equivalent steps.\n4. The equivalent of `os.path.realpath` involves checking each path component to see if it's a symbolic link and resolving it if so.\n5. We can use `os.path.split` to separate the path into components and then iterate through them to resolve symbolic links and redundant segments.\n6. To normalize the path, we need to handle .. and . segments by either removing them or adjusting the path accordingly.\n7. After getting the canonical path, we need to return only the directory part of it, which can be achieved by using `os.path.dirname`.\n8. However, since we are not allowed to directly use `os.path.realpath`, we need to implement its functionality manually.\n9. Manually resolving symbolic links involves checking if a path component is a symbolic link using `os.path.islink` and then reading the link using `os.readlink` to get the actual path.\n10. The final canonical path should be obtained by joining the resolved components.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Get the absolute path of the input file path using `os.path.abspath`.\n2. Split the absolute path into its components using `os.path.split` iteratively.\n3. Iterate through each component, checking if it's a symbolic link using `os.path.islink`. If it is, resolve the link using `os.readlink`.\n4. Normalize the path by handling .. and . segments. This involves maintaining a stack of path components and adjusting it according to .. or . encountered.\n5. Join the normalized, resolved path components to form the canonical path.\n6. Use `os.path.dirname` on the canonical path to get the directory part.\n7. Ensure the returned directory path does not have a trailing separator unless it's the root directory /.\n8.

{"task_id": 472, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem and the Requirements\nThe task is to implement a numerically stable softmax function along with its element-wise gradient. The input can be a one-dimensional or two-dimensional list, and the output should be a tuple containing the softmax probabilities and their gradient, both having the same shape as the input and rounded to four decimal places.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the Input to a NumPy Array for Easier Manipulation\nTo simplify the calculations, we first convert the input list (or list of lists) into a NumPy array. This allows us to easily perform operations along specific axes.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the Maximum Value Along the Last Axis\nTo ensure numerical stability, we need to subtract the maximum value along the last axis from each element in the input array. This is done using `np.max(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)`, which keeps the maximum value in the same shape as the input array for broadcasting.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Softmax Transformation\nThe softmax transformation is applied by first subtracting the maximum value from each element, then taking the exponential of the result, and finally dividing by the sum of these exponentials along the last axis. This is represented by the formula: `softmax(x_i) = exp(x_i \u2212 max(x)) / \u03a3_j exp(x_j \u2212 max(x))`.\n\n## Step 5: Compute the Softmax Probabilities\nUsing NumPy, we compute `exp(x - max(x))` and then divide by the sum of this expression along the last axis to get the softmax probabilities.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the Element-Wise Gradient of the Softmax\nThe gradient of the softmax with respect to each element is given by `grad_i = softmax(x_i) * (1 - softmax(x_i))`. We calculate this using the softmax probabilities obtained in the previous step.\n\n## Step 7: Round the Results to Four Decimal Places and Convert Back to Python Lists\nAfter calculating the softmax probabilities and their gradient, we round these values to four decimal places.

The function should accept the number of classes `m`, the number of training samples per class `n_train`, the number of validation samples per class `n_val`, the vertical distance between the rows of class clusters `interval`, and an optional random seed `seed` for reproducibility.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- The number of classes `m` should be at least 2.\n- The function should return four NumPy arrays: `X_train`, `X_val`, `Y_train`, `Y_val`.\n- The shape of `X_train` and `X_val` should be `(m*n_train, 2)` and `(m*n_val, 2)` respectively.\n- The shape of `Y_train` and `Y_val` should be `(m*n_train,)` and `(m*n_val,)` respectively.\n- All coordinates in `X_train` and `X_val` should be rounded to 4 decimal places.\n- If a random seed is provided, it should be used to seed the random number generator for reproducibility.\n\n# Key Insights\n- The x-coordinate of a point is generated using a uniform distribution between `(floor(i/2) + 0.1)*10` and `(floor(i/2) + 0.9)*10`, where `i` is the class index starting at 0.\n- The y-coordinate of a point is generated using a uniform distribution between `((i mod 2)*interval + 0.1)*10` and `((i mod 2)*interval + 0.9)*10`.\n- The label of a point is calculated as `(i - 0.5)*2`, which results in -1 for the first class and +1 for the second class. However, the problem statement implies that this formula might need to be adjusted or understood in the context of `m` classes.\n- For `m` classes, the x-coordinate generation rule depends on `floor(i/2)`, which means that the x-coordinate range will be the same for consecutive classes (e.g., class 0 and 1, class 2 and 3, etc.).\n- The given formula for the label suggests a binary classification problem. For `m` classes, the labeling scheme might need to be adjusted.\n- The problem requires generating data for `m` classes, but the labeling scheme provided in the problem statement is specifically for binary classification.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n1.

This ensures that the moments are properly initialized for the Adam update step.\n* It then computes the new first moment `m_new` and second moment `v_new` using the given formulae: `m_new = b1 * m_prev + (1 - b1) * grad` and `v_new = b2 * v_prev + (1 - b2) * grad\u00b2`. The `np.square(grad)` is used to compute `grad\u00b2`.\n* The bias-corrected moments `m_hat` and `v_hat` are computed by dividing `m_new` and `v_new` by `(1 - b1 ** t)` and `(1 - b2 ** t)`, respectively. These corrected moments are then used to update the parameters `w` to obtain `w_new`.\n* Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the updated parameters `w_new`, the new first moment `m_new`, and the new second moment `v_new`, all of which have the same shape as the corresponding input parameters."}

It takes a 2D NumPy array `data` and parameters `eps` and `min_samples` as input and returns a list of cluster labels for each sample in `data`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The function starts by checking if the input `data` is empty. If so, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it initializes a list `labels` with -1 for each data point, indicating that they are initially considered noise.\n2.  **DBSCAN Clustering**: The algorithm then iterates over each data point. If a point is already labeled (i.e., not -1), it skips to the next point. For each unlabeled point, it calculates the neighbors within the `eps` radius using the `get_neighbors` function.\n3.  **Core Point Identification**: If a point has at least `min_samples` neighbors, it's considered a core point. The algorithm labels this core point with the current `cluster_id` and expands the cluster using the `expand_cluster` function.\n4.  **Cluster Expansion**: The `expand_cluster` function is a recursive process that labels all density-connected points with the same `cluster_id`. It uses a stack to keep track of points to visit. For each point, it checks if it's a core point and, if so, adds its neighbors to the stack. This process continues until all reachable points are labeled.\n5.  **Labeling**: The algorithm assigns a unique `cluster_id` to each cluster, starting from 0 and incrementing for each new cluster discovered. Points that are not part of any dense region remain labeled as -1 (noise).\n6.  **Result**: Finally, the function returns the list of cluster labels for all data points.\n\nThe code includes example usage at the end, demonstrating how to apply DBSCAN to a random dataset and print the resulting cluster labels."}

This allows for easier manipulation of the input data.\n* It then checks if `num_classes` is provided. If not, it infers the number of classes from the maximum label in `y` plus one. If `num_classes` is provided, it validates that all labels in `y` are within the range `[0, num_classes)`, raising a `ValueError` if any label is out of range.\n* The function creates a matrix `categorical` filled with zeros, with shape `(len(y), num_classes)` and dtype `int`. It then uses advanced indexing to set the appropriate elements to 1, effectively one-hot encoding the labels.\n* Finally, the function returns the `categorical` matrix, which represents the one-hot encoding of the input labels."}
{"task_id": 483, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "# Problem Understanding\nThe task is to implement a Python function `to_categorical` that converts a 1-D array-like object of non-negative integer labels into their one-hot encoded representation. The function should behave like Keras' `to_categorical`.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- The input `labels` is a sequence of int or 1-D np.ndarray.\n- The input `num_classes` is an optional int parameter.\n- If `num_classes` is not supplied, it should be inferred as `max(label)+1`.\n- If `num_classes` is supplied, the returned vectors must have this length.\n- The function should always return a Python list of lists whose elements are 0/1 integers.\n- The output should contain only 0s and 1s.\n\nInput: A sequence of non-negative integers (`labels`) and an optional integer (`num_classes`).\nOutput: A list of lists containing the one-hot encoded representation of the input labels.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n- The function should work with both Python sequences and NumPy arrays as input.\n- The output should be a list of lists, not a NumPy array.\n\n# Key Insights\n- To solve this problem, we need to understand what one-hot encoding is and how to determine the length of the one-hot vectors.\n- One-hot encoding is a binary vector that contains a single 1 marking the class index and 0s everywhere else.\n- The length of the one-hot vectors can be determined by either the supplied `num_classes` or inferred from the maximum label value plus one.\n- We can use NumPy to efficiently create the one-hot encoded representation.\n- The input labels need to be converted to a NumPy array to use its functionalities.\n- We need to determine the number of classes (`num_classes`) based on the input labels and the optional `num_classes` parameter.\n- If `num_classes` is not provided, we need to infer it from the maximum label value plus one.\n- We can create a matrix of zeros with the shape of (number of labels, number of classes) and then set the appropriate index to 1 to achieve one-hot encoding.\n- Advanced indexing in NumPy can be used to set the correct elements to 1.\n- The resulting NumPy array needs to be converted to a list of lists before being returned.\n- The output should contain only 0s and 1s, which is inherently satisfied by the one-hot encoding process.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n1. Convert the input `labels` to a NumPy array to utilize its functionalities.\n2. Determine the number of classes (`num_classes`): if it's not provided, infer it from the maximum label value plus one; otherwise, use the provided value.\n3.

The function `k_means` should take a 2D NumPy array `X` and a positive integer `k` as input and return a list of cluster indices for each sample in `X`.\n\n## Implementation\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef k_means(X: np.ndarray, k: int, max_iters: int = 300, tol: float = 1e-4) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Cluster the data contained in *X* into *k* groups using the K-Means algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        X: NumPy array of shape (n_samples, n_features) containing the data points.\n        k: The desired number of clusters (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n_samples).\n        max_iters: Maximum number of iterations (default 300).\n        tol: Convergence tolerance.

The function `k_means` initializes the centroids with the first `k` samples of the input data `X`.\n2.  It then enters a loop that continues until convergence or until the maximum number of iterations (`max_iters`) is reached.\n3.  Inside the loop, it calculates the Euclidean distance between each sample in `X` and the current centroids.\n4.  The cluster index for each sample is determined by finding the index of the nearest centroid.\n5.  The centroids are updated to be the mean of the samples assigned to each cluster. If a centroid loses all its assigned samples, it remains unchanged.\n6.  The algorithm checks for convergence by calculating the Euclidean distance between the old and new centroids. If this distance is less than the specified tolerance (`tol`), the loop exits.\n7.  Finally, the function returns a Python list containing the cluster index for each sample in the original order.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nThe example code generates random 2D data, performs K-Means clustering with `k = 5`, and prints the resulting cluster indices. You can modify the `X` and `k` to suit your specific use case."}

The output will be a list of frequent item-sets that meet the specified minimum support threshold, sorted according to the required criteria."}

The function `random_bernoulli_mab` takes an integer `n_arms` as input and returns a list of floats representing the success probabilities of each arm.\n2. It first checks if `n_arms` is less than 1. If so, it returns an empty list as per the task requirements.\n3. It generates `n_arms` random numbers between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) using `np.random.uniform(0, 1, n_arms)`.\n4. These numbers are then normalized by their sum to ensure they form a valid probability distribution.\n5. The normalized probabilities are rounded to 4 decimal places using `np.round`.\n6. Finally, the rounded probabilities are converted to a Python list using the `tolist()` method and returned.\n\n### Notes\n\n- The use of `np.random.uniform` ensures that the generated numbers are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.\n- Normalizing the generated numbers by their sum ensures that the resulting probabilities add up to 1, forming a valid probability distribution.\n- Rounding the probabilities to 4 decimal places is done to meet the output constraints specified in the task."}

{"task_id": 528, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe task is to generate a grid of labels for a 2-D linear classifier defined by a weight vector `W = [w\u2081, w\u2082]` and a bias `b`. The grid should span the bounding box of the input data `X`, which is a 2-D dataset with shape `n \u00d7 2`. The desired resolution of the grid is given by `grid_n`, which defaults to 100.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The input data `X` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two numbers (`x\u2081, x\u2082`).\n- The weight vector `W` is a list or tuple with exactly two elements (`w\u2081, w\u2082`).\n- The bias `b` is a single number.\n- The grid resolution `grid_n` is a positive integer that defaults to 100.\n- The classification rule is `sign(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082 + b)`, where `sign(z)` returns 1 if `z \u2265 0` and -1 otherwise.\n- The output should be a 2-D Python list with shape `grid_n \u00d7 grid_n` containing only the integers 1 and -1.\n\nInput: `X`, `W`, `b`, `grid_n`\nOutput: A 2-D Python list of labels with shape `grid_n \u00d7 grid_n`\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n- The grid should span the bounding box of `X`, meaning the minimum and maximum values of `x\u2081` and `x\u2082` in `X` should be used to determine the grid's extent.\n- The classification rule should be applied exactly as stated, without any modifications or optimizations.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n1. **Grid Generation**: To generate the grid, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of `x\u2081` and `x\u2082` in the input data `X`. We can then use these values to create two 1-D arrays, `x1_plot` and `x2_plot`, each of length `grid_n`, that span the range of `x\u2081` and `x\u2082` values in `X`.\n2. **Meshgrid Creation**: We need to create a meshgrid from `x1_plot` and `x2_plot` to get all the grid points. This will give us two 2-D arrays, `X1` and `X2`, where `X1` contains the `x\u2081` coordinates of the grid points and `X2` contains the `x\u2082` coordinates.\n3. **Classification**: To classify each grid point, we need to apply the classification rule `sign(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082 + b)` to each point `(x\u2081, x\u2082)` in the grid. We can do this by computing `w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082 + b` for each point and then applying the `sign` function to the result.\n4. **Output Formatting**: The final output should be a 2-D Python list with shape `grid_n \u00d7 grid_n` containing only the integers 1 and -1. We need to ensure that the classified labels are formatted correctly.\n\nImportant realizations:\n\n- We need to use NumPy to efficiently generate the grid and perform the classification.\n- We should avoid using any third-party machine-learning libraries and stick to NumPy.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. **Convert Input Data to NumPy Arrays**: Convert the input data `X` to a NumPy array to easily find the minimum and maximum values of `x\u2081` and `x\u2082`.\n2. **Find Min and Max Values**: Find the minimum and maximum values of `x\u2081` and `x\u2082` in `X` using the NumPy array.\n3. **Generate 1-D Arrays**: Generate `x1_plot` and `x2_plot` using NumPy's `linspace` function, spanning the range of `x\u2081` and `x\u2082` values in `X` with `grid_n` points.\n4. **Create Meshgrid**: Create a meshgrid from `x1_plot` and `x2_plot` using NumPy's `meshgrid` function to get the grid points.\n5. **Classify Grid Points**: Classify each grid point by computing `w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082 + b` and applying the `sign` function to the result. Use NumPy's vectorized operations to efficiently classify all grid points.\n6. **Format Output**: Convert the classified labels to a 2-D Python list with shape `grid_n \u00d7 grid_n` containing only the integers 1 and -1.\n7. **Return Output**: Return the formatted output.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef decision_boundary_grid(X: list[list[int | float]],\n                           W: list[int | float],\n                           b: float,\n                           grid_n: int = 100) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a matrix of predictions for a 2-D linear classifier.\n\n    A point (x\u2081 , x\u2082) is labelled with 1 if w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082 + b \u2265 0 and\n    with \u20111 otherwise.

The function `compute_cost` takes two NumPy arrays `AL` and `Y` as input, representing the model probabilities and true labels, respectively.\n2. It checks if `AL` and `Y` have the same shape and raises a `ValueError` if they do not.\n3. The number of training examples `m` is determined by the size of `AL`.\n4. The probabilities in `AL` are clipped to the range `[1e-15, 1 - 1e-15]` to avoid numerical overflow when taking the logarithm.\n5. The binary cross-entropy cost is computed using the formula `J = \u2212 1\u2044m \u00b7 \u03a3 [ y\u00b7ln(a) + (1\u2212y)\u00b7ln(1\u2212a) ]`.\n6. The cost is returned as a Python `float`.\n7.

It then iterates over each sample in the input `data`.\n* For each sample, it checks if the feature value at index `fea` is greater than or equal to the given `value`. If true, the sample is appended to `set1`; otherwise, it's appended to `set2`.\n* The function maintains the original order of samples within `set1` and `set2` by iterating through `data` in order and appending samples to the appropriate list.\n* Finally, the function returns a tuple containing `set1` and `set2`, fulfilling the requirement of returning two lists that preserve the original ordering."}
{"task_id": 545, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "# Problem Understanding\nThe problem requires implementing a function `tree_stats` that calculates two statistics about a given binary decision tree: the total number of leaf nodes and the maximum depth of the tree. The tree is represented using a `node` class, where each node has attributes for the feature used for splitting, the split value, the label or label distribution for a leaf node, and references to its right and left children.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- The tree can be empty (`root is None`).\n- The tree may be highly unbalanced.\n- Both statistics must be computed using a single recursive traversal.\n\nInput: The root of the binary decision tree, which can be `None` for an empty tree.\nOutput: A tuple containing two integers: the total number of leaf nodes (`leaf_count`) and the maximum depth of the tree (`max_depth`).\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n- A node is considered a leaf if its `results` attribute is not `None`.\n- The depth of an empty tree is considered to be `0`, and the depth of a tree with a single root node is `1`.\n\n# Key Insights\n- To solve this problem, we need to traverse the tree recursively to count the number of leaf nodes and calculate the maximum depth.\n- A node is a leaf if its `results` attribute is not `None`, which is the condition to increment the `leaf_count`.\n- The maximum depth can be calculated by recursively finding the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees and adding `1` to the maximum of these depths.\n- If the tree is empty (`root is None`), we should return `(0, 0)` as there are no leaf nodes and the depth is `0`.\n- We can combine the calculation of `leaf_count` and `max_depth` into a single recursive traversal by returning both values from the recursive function.\n- At each node, we recursively call the function on the left and right children, and then combine the results to get the total `leaf_count` and `max_depth`.\n- For a leaf node, `leaf_count` is `1` and `max_depth` is `1` because we count the node itself.\n- For a non-leaf node, we sum the `leaf_count` from its children and take the maximum `max_depth` from its children, adding `1` for the current node.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n1. Define a recursive function that takes the root of the tree (or subtree) as input and returns a tuple containing the `leaf_count` and `max_depth`.\n2. If the tree is empty (`root is None`), return `(0, 0)` immediately.\n3. If the current node is a leaf (`root.results is not None`), return `(1, 1)` because it counts as one leaf and has a depth of `1`.\n4. Recursively call the function on the left and right children of the current node.\n5. Combine the results from the recursive calls: sum the `leaf_count` values and take the maximum of the `max_depth` values, then add `1` to the `max_depth` to account for the current node.\n6. Return the combined `leaf_count` and `max_depth` as a tuple.\n7.

For each feature and value, we create a mask to split the data into left and right child nodes based on the condition `X[:, feature_index] == value`.\n3.  **Computing Gini Impurity for Child Nodes**: We compute the Gini impurity for the left and right child nodes (`left_gini` and `right_gini`) using their respective class labels. We then calculate the weighted Gini impurity (`weighted_gini`) based on the proportion of samples in each child node.\n4.  **Updating Best Split**: If the weighted Gini impurity is less than the current best Gini impurity (`best_gini`), we update the best feature index, split value, and the best Gini impurity.\n5.  **Returning the Result**: After iterating over all features and values, we check if the best split reduces the Gini impurity by at least `epsilon` compared to the parent node. If not, or if no valid split is found, we return (-1, None, `parent_gini`). Otherwise, we return the best feature index, split value, and the corresponding Gini impurity.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\nX = np.array([[1, 'a'], [2, 'b'], [1, 'a'], [2, 'b']], dtype=object)\ny = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])\n\nresult = best_gini_split(X, y)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use the `best_gini_split` function with a sample dataset (`X` and `y`). The function returns the best feature index, split value, and the corresponding Gini impurity based on the Gini impurity criterion."}

The HMM is defined by its parameters: initial distribution $\\pi$, transition matrix $A$, and emission matrix $B$. The function takes as input the HMM parameters, a sequence of observations $O$, and a time index $t$.\n\n## Step 2: Check if Time Index $t$ is Within the Valid Range\nThe function should first check if $t$ is within the range $[0, len(observations) - 1]$. If $t$ is outside this range, the function should return an empty list.\n\n## Step 3: Compute Forward Probabilities $\\alpha$\nTo compute $\\alpha_t(i)$, which is the probability of the partial observation sequence up to $t$ and being in state $i$ at $t$, we use the forward algorithm. The forward algorithm initializes $\\alpha_0(i) = \\pi_i \\cdot B_{i, O_0}$ and then iteratively computes $\\alpha_{t+1}(j) = \\sum_{i} \\alpha_t(i) \\cdot A_{i, j} \\cdot B_{j, O_{t+1}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Compute Backward Probabilities $\\beta$\nTo compute $\\beta_t(i)$, which is the probability of the remaining observation sequence from $t+1$ given that the state at $t$ is $i$, we use the backward algorithm. The backward algorithm initializes $\\beta_{T-1}(i) = 1$ for all $i$, where $T = len(observations)$, and then iteratively computes $\\beta_t(i) = \\sum_{j} A_{i, j} \\cdot B_{j, O_{t+1}} \\cdot \\beta_{t+1}(j)$.\n\n## Step 5: Combine $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ to Obtain $\\gamma_t$\n$\\gamma_t(i) = \\frac{\\alpha_t(i) \\cdot \\beta_t(i)}{\\sum_j \\alpha_t(j) \\cdot \\beta_t(j)}$.

The function should return a list of length N containing the final cluster label of each sample.\n\n## Step 2: Initialize the parameters of K Gaussian components\nTo start, we need to randomly initialize the parameters of K Gaussian components, which include mixture weights, means, and full covariance matrices. The mixture weights should sum to 1, the means should be random points from the data or within the data range, and the covariance matrices should be positive semi-definite.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the Expectation (E) step\nIn the E-step, we calculate the responsibility of each component for each data point. This involves computing the probability of each data point under each Gaussian component and then normalizing these probabilities to obtain the responsibility of each component for each data point.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the Maximization (M) step\nIn the M-step, we update the parameters (mixture weights, means, and covariance matrices) of the Gaussian components based on the responsibilities calculated in the E-step. The new mixture weights are the average responsibilities of each component across all data points. The new means are calculated as the weighted average of the data points, where the weights are the responsibilities. The new covariance matrices are calculated based on the weighted average of the squared differences between the data points and the new means.\n\n## Step 5: Repeat the E and M steps until convergence\nWe repeat the E and M steps until either the maximum number of iterations is reached or the change in mixture weights is smaller than a prescribed tolerance.\n\n## Step 6: Assign each sample to the component with the largest posterior probability\nAfter convergence, we assign each sample to the component with the largest posterior probability (responsibility).\n\n## Step 7: Sort the components by their mean's first coordinate and re-label\nTo make the output deterministic, we sort the components by the first coordinate of their mean in ascending order and re-label the cluster indices accordingly.\n\n## Step 8: Implement the solution in Python\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef gmm_em(data: np.ndarray, k: int, max_iter: int = 200, epsilon: float = 1e-4) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Gaussian Mixture Model via Expectation-Maximization algorithm.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - data (np.ndarray): A 2-D NumPy array containing N samples with D features.\n    - k (int): The number of Gaussian components.\n    - max_iter (int): The maximum number of iterations.

The function takes a data matrix X and a 1-D label vector y as input, where X contains discrete feature values encoded as non-negative integers starting from 0, and y contains integer class labels starting from 0.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- X is a 2-D array of shape (n_samples, n_features) containing discrete feature values.\n- y is a 1-D array of shape (n_samples,) containing integer class labels.\n- The feature values and class labels are non-negative integers starting from 0.\n- If two or more features obtain the same (maximal) information gain, the smallest column index must be returned.\n- The function must return a tuple `(best_feature_index, max_information_gain)` where the gain is rounded to 6 decimal places.\n\nInput: X (np.ndarray), y (np.ndarray)\nOutput: tuple[int, float]\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n- The input data is assumed to be valid, i.e., X and y are np.ndarray objects with the correct shape and data type.\n- The function does not need to handle cases where X or y is empty.\n\n# Key Insights\n- To solve this problem, we need to calculate the information gain for each feature in X with respect to the class label y.\n- The information gain of a feature A is defined as IG(A) = H(y) - H(y|A), where H(y) is the entropy of the label distribution and H(y|A) is the conditional entropy obtained after splitting by the values of A.\n- We need to calculate the entropy H(y) of the label distribution.\n- For each feature A, we need to calculate the conditional entropy H(y|A) after splitting by the values of A.\n- The conditional entropy H(y|A) can be calculated by iterating over the possible values of A, calculating the probability of each value, and then calculating the entropy of the label distribution conditioned on each value.\n- We need to iterate over all features in X, calculate the information gain for each feature, and keep track of the feature with the maximum information gain.\n- If two or more features have the same maximum information gain, we need to return the smallest column index.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n- An example with X = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]) and y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0]) is used to verify the implementation.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n1.

We will use a dictionary `keyword_counts` where the keys are the class labels and the values are another dictionary with keyword counts for that class. We also need to store the total number of documents for each class in `class_counts`.\n\n## Step 3: Count the occurrences of keywords in the training data\nWe iterate over `train_data` to count the occurrences of keywords for each class and store the total count of documents for each class.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the conditional probabilities P(w|c) for each keyword w and class c\nUsing the counts from Step 3, we calculate `P(w|c)` for each keyword `w` and class `c` by dividing the count of `w` in class `c` by the total number of documents in class `c`.\n\n## Step 5: Predict the labels for the test samples\nFor each document in `test_samples`, we calculate the likelihood for each class by multiplying the probabilities of the keywords that are present in the document and the probabilities of the keywords that are not present (1 - P(w|c)).

The index list of k nearest neighbors for each sample is obtained by sorting the distance matrix and taking the indices of the k nearest neighbors.\n5.  The reachability distance between two points is defined as the maximum of the k-distance of the second point and the Euclidean distance between the two points. This is computed for all pairs of points.\n6.  The Local Reachability Density (LRD) is calculated for each sample by summing the reachability distances to its k nearest neighbors and taking the reciprocal.\n7.  Finally, the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is computed for each sample by comparing its LRD to the LRD of its k nearest neighbors.\n8.  The LOF scores are rounded to four decimals, and samples with LOF scores greater than `epsilon` are identified as outliers.\n9.  The function returns a tuple containing the list of LOF scores and the list of indices of outlier samples, sorted in ascending order."}

This step is crucial as it determines the number of edges to be considered for each point.\n\n2. **Computing Euclidean Distances**: To find the k nearest neighbors for each point, we first need to compute the Euclidean distance between every pair of points. This can be efficiently done using NumPy's vectorized operations.\n\n3. **Finding k Nearest Neighbors**: For each point, we sort the distances to other points and select the k smallest ones. The indices of these k nearest neighbors are stored. This step involves using numpy.argsort to resolve ties based on index order.\n\n4. **Constructing the Directed Graph**: We create a directed edge i \u2192 j if j is among the k nearest neighbors of i. This is done by iterating over the points and their respective k nearest neighbors.\n\n5. **Symmetrizing the Graph**: To convert the directed graph into an undirected one, we add an edge (i, j) if either i \u2192 j or j \u2192 i exists. This step is crucial for constructing the undirected k-NN graph.\n\n6. **Creating the Adjacency Matrix**: Finally, we construct the adjacency matrix W where W[i][j] = 1 if an undirected edge (i, j) exists, and W[i][j] = 0 otherwise. The matrix W is then converted to a list of lists as required by the problem.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights include considering the case when n = 1 and understanding how to handle ties in nearest neighbor selection.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. **Calculate k**: Determine the value of k using the given formula k = min(\u230a\u221an\u230b, 10), where n is the number of samples in X.\n\n2. **Compute Euclidean Distances**: Use NumPy to compute the Euclidean distance between every pair of points in X.\n\n3. **Find k Nearest Neighbors for Each Point**: For each point, sort the distances to other points, and select the k nearest distinct points. Store the indices of these points.\n\n4. **Construct the Directed Graph**: Create a directed edge i \u2192 j if j is among the k nearest neighbors of i.\n\n5. **Symmetrize the Graph**: Convert the directed graph into an undirected graph by adding an edge (i, j) if either i \u2192 j or j \u2192 i exists.\n\n6. **Create the Adjacency Matrix W**: Initialize W as a matrix of zeros. Set W[i][j] = 1 if an undirected edge (i, j) exists.\n\n7. **Convert W to a List of Lists**: Finally, convert the adjacency matrix W into a standard Python list of lists and return it.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef nearest_neighbor_graph(X):\n    X = np.array(X)\n    n = X.shape[0]\n    if n == 1:\n        return [[0]]\n    \n    k = min(int(np.sqrt(n)), 10)\n    \n    # Compute Euclidean distances\n    distances = np.linalg.norm(X[:, np.newaxis] - X, axis=2)\n    np.fill_diagonal(distances, np.inf)  # To avoid selecting the point itself as a neighbor\n    \n    # Find k nearest neighbors for each point\n    nearest_neighbors = np.argsort(distances, axis=1)[:, :k]\n    \n    # Initialize the adjacency matrix\n    W = np.zeros((n, n))\n    \n    # Construct the directed graph\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in nearest_neighbors[i]:\n            W[i, j] = 1\n    \n    # Symmetrize the graph to make it undirected\n    W = np.logical_or(W, W.T).astype(int)\n    \n    # Convert the adjacency matrix to a list of lists\n    return W.tolist()\n```"}

If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `-1`.\n2. If `a` equals `b`, it returns `0`.\n3. For all other cases (i.e., `a` is greater than `b`), it returns `1`.\n\nThis implementation works with any pair of objects that support the standard comparison operators, such as numbers, strings, tuples, and lists.\n\n### Example Usage\n```python\n# Comparing numbers\nprint(cmp(5, 10))  # Output: -1\nprint(cmp(10, 5))  # Output: 1\nprint(cmp(5, 5))   # Output: 0\n\n# Comparing strings\nprint(cmp(\"apple\", \"banana\"))  # Output: -1\nprint(cmp(\"banana\", \"apple\"))  # Output: 1\nprint(cmp(\"apple\", \"apple\"))   # Output: 0\n\n# Comparing lists\nprint(cmp([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4]))  # Output: -1\nprint(cmp([1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 1\nprint(cmp([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Alternative Implementation Using the `operator` Module\nWhile the above implementation is straightforward, an alternative approach could utilize the `operator` module for comparisons. However, for this specific task, the simple comparison operators suffice and are more readable.\n\n### Notes\n- The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs. It assumes that the provided objects support comparison operations. If the objects do not support these operations, a `TypeError` will be raised.\n- The return type is constrained to `-1`, `0`, or `1`, as per the task requirements."}

The function `kmeans_centroids` takes a 2D NumPy array `X`, an integer `k`, and an optional `max_iters` parameter.\n2.  It initializes the centroids with the first `k` samples of `X`.\n3.  The algorithm iterates until convergence or `max_iters` is reached. In each iteration, it assigns every sample to the nearest centroid based on the squared Euclidean distance.\n4.  The centroids are updated to the mean of the samples assigned to them. If a cluster becomes empty, its centroid remains unchanged.\n5.  The algorithm checks for convergence by comparing the difference between the new and old centroids. If all centroids move less than `1e-4`, it stops early.\n6.  Finally, the centroids are sorted in ascending lexicographical order, rounded to 4 decimal places, and returned as a list of lists.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `kmeans_centroids` function with random data and print the resulting centroids."}

Initialize an empty dictionary to store the adjacency list.\n2. Iterate over each cell in the 2-D NumPy array using its indices.\n3. For each cell, check if it's a free block (i.e., its value is 1). If so, add its coordinates to the dictionary.\n4. For each free block, check its four neighbors (up, down, left, and right) to see if they are within the maze boundaries and are also free blocks.\n5. If a neighbor is a free block, add its coordinates to the list of neighbors for the current free block in the dictionary.\n6. After checking all neighbors for a free block, ensure that the list of neighbors is sorted in ascending lexicographic order.\n7. Return the dictionary representing the adjacency list.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle:\n\n- Check the boundaries of the maze when checking neighbors to avoid index out-of-range errors.\n- Handle the case where the maze is empty or contains no free blocks by returning an empty dictionary.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef convert_maze_to_graph(maze: np.ndarray) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Convert a binary maze to an adjacency-list representation.\n\n    You are given a 2-D NumPy array in which 1 represents a free cell and 0\n    represents a wall.
