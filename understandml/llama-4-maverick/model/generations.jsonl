If it's not invertible, the function returns `[-1]`."}

{"task_id": 20, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the requirements\nThe task is to implement a function `sigmoid_activation` that computes the sigmoid of a given input `x` and its gradient. The input `x` can be a scalar (`int` or `float`), a Python list, or a NumPy array. The function should return a tuple containing the sigmoid of `x` and its gradient, both rounded to 4 decimal places. If `x` is a scalar, the return values should be `float`; if `x` is array-like, the return values should be Python lists.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the input to a NumPy array for uniform processing\nTo handle different types of input uniformly, we first need to convert the input into a NumPy array if it's not already one. This includes converting Python lists to NumPy arrays.\n\n## Step 3: Compute the sigmoid of the input\nThe sigmoid function is defined as $\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$. We will use NumPy's vectorized operations to compute this for all elements of the input array.\n\n## Step 4: Compute the gradient of the sigmoid\nThe derivative of the sigmoid function is given by $\\sigma'(x) = \\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x))$. We will compute this using the sigmoid values obtained in the previous step.\n\n## Step 5: Round the results to 4 decimal places\nBoth the sigmoid values and their gradients need to be rounded to 4 decimal places.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the return type based on the input type\nIf the input is a scalar, we should return `float` values. If the input is array-like, we should return Python lists.\n\n## Step 7: Implement the solution in Python\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sigmoid_activation(x):\n    \"\"\"Compute the sigmoid of *x* and its gradient.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : float | int | list | numpy.ndarray\n        Input data that can be a scalar, a Python list, or a NumPy array.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple\n        A tuple (sigmoid_x, gradient_x)\n        where each element is rounded to 4 decimal places and returned as:\n        \u2022 float when *x* is scalar\n        \u2022 Python list when *x* is array-like\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if input is a scalar\n    is_scalar = isinstance(x, (int, float))\n    \n    # Convert input to NumPy array for uniform processing\n    if not isinstance(x, np.ndarray):\n        x = np.array(x)\n    \n    # Compute sigmoid\n    sigmoid_x = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))\n    \n    # Compute gradient of sigmoid\n    gradient_x = sigmoid_x * (1 - sigmoid_x)\n    \n    # Round results to 4 decimal places\n    sigmoid_x = np.round(sigmoid_x, 4)\n    gradient_x = np.round(gradient_x, 4)\n    \n    # Convert results to Python lists if input was array-like\n    if not is_scalar:\n        sigmoid_x = sigmoid_x.tolist()\n        gradient_x = gradient_x.tolist()\n    else:\n        # If input was scalar, extract the scalar value\n        sigmoid_x = float(sigmoid_x)\n        gradient_x = float(gradient_x)\n    \n    return sigmoid_x, gradient_x\n```\n\n## Step 8: Verify the implementation meets all requirements\n- The function works with scalars, Python lists, and NumPy arrays.\n- It returns a tuple containing the sigmoid values and their gradients.\n- The return values are rounded to 4 decimal places.\n- For scalar inputs, the return values are `float`.\n- For array-like inputs, the return values are Python lists.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sigmoid_activation(x):\n    \"\"\"Compute the sigmoid of *x* and its gradient.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : float | int | list | numpy.ndarray\n        Input data that can be a scalar, a Python list, or a NumPy array.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple\n        A tuple (sigmoid_x, gradient_x)\n        where each element is rounded to 4 decimal places and returned as:\n        \u2022 float when *x* is scalar\n        \u2022 Python list when *x* is array-like\n    \"\"\"\n    is_scalar = isinstance(x, (int, float))\n    if not isinstance(x, np.ndarray):\n        x = np.array(x)\n    sigmoid_x = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))\n    gradient_x = sigmoid_x * (1 - sigmoid_x)\n    sigmoid_x = np.round(sigmoid_x, 4)\n    gradient_x = np.round(gradient_x, 4)\n    if not is_scalar:\n        sigmoid_x = sigmoid_x.tolist()\n        gradient_x = gradient_x.tolist()\n    else:\n        sigmoid_x = float(sigmoid_x)\n        gradient_x = float(gradient_x)\n    return sigmoid_x, gradient_x\n```"}

Entries that are greater than or equal to \\(1 - sparsity\\) are set to `1.0`, and others are set to `0.0`. This is achieved by the expression `(random_array >= (1 - sparsity))`, which produces a boolean array that is then cast to `np.float64` to meet the output requirements.\n5. **Return**: The resulting binary array is returned.

The function should return a 3-tuple containing the row index of the median value in the specified column, and two lists of row indices: one for values smaller than the median and one for values larger than the median.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The input `data` is a 2D NumPy array of shape `(n_samples, n_features)`.\n- The input `d` is an integer representing the column index to use for the split.\n- The function must execute in O(n) time complexity using `numpy.argpartition`.\n- The lists of indices in the result must be sorted increasingly.\n- For even `n_samples`, the position `n//2` should be used to determine the median.\n- The function should return the row index of the median value, not the median value itself.\n- The function should return lists of row indices for values strictly smaller and strictly larger than the median.\n\nInput: A 2D NumPy array `data` and an integer `d`.\nOutput: A 3-tuple `(pivot, left, right)` where `pivot` is the row index of the median value, and `left` and `right` are lists of row indices with values smaller and larger than the median, respectively.\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n- The use of `numpy.argpartition` is required to achieve O(n) time complexity.\n- The lists `left` and `right` must be sorted increasingly.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task requires finding the median of a specific column in a 2D NumPy array and splitting the data into three parts: the median (or pivot) element, elements smaller than the median, and elements larger than the median.\n\n2. **Using `numpy.argpartition`**: To achieve an O(n) time complexity, `numpy.argpartition` is used. This function returns the indices that would partition the array at the specified position.\n\n3. **Finding the Median Index**: The median index in the sorted column is `n_samples // 2`, where `n_samples` is the number of rows in `data`. Using `numpy.argpartition` with `kth=n_samples // 2` gives the index of the median value in the unsorted column.\n\n4. **Calculating the Pivot and Splitting the Data**: After finding the index of the median value, the row index of this median value in the original array is determined. Then, the data is split into `left` and `right` based on values smaller and larger than the median value.\n\n5. **Sorting the Lists**: Finally, the lists `left` and `right` are sorted in ascending order to meet the output requirements.\n\n6. **Implementation Details**: \n    - The column `d` of `data` is considered for finding the median.\n    - `numpy.argpartition` is used to find the index that would be the median if the column were sorted.\n    - The actual median value is found by indexing into the column with the index obtained from `numpy.argpartition`.\n    - The row index of the median value in the original `data` array is found and returned as `pivot`.\n    - Other row indices are categorized into `left` and `right` based on whether their corresponding values in column `d` are less than or greater than the median value.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. **Extract the Column**: Extract the column `d` from `data` to work with.\n   \n2. **Use `numpy.argpartition`**: Apply `numpy.argpartition` on the extracted column to find the index of the median value. The `kth` parameter should be set to `n_samples // 2`, where `n_samples` is the number of rows in `data`.\n\n3. **Find the Median Value's Row Index**: Use the index obtained from `numpy.argpartition` to find the row index of the median value in the original `data` array.\n\n4. **Split the Data**: Iterate through the rows of `data` and compare their values in column `d` with the median value. Collect row indices of values less than the median into `left` and those greater than the median into `right`.\n\n5. **Sort `left` and `right`**: Sort the lists `left` and `right` in ascending order.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Return a 3-tuple containing the row index of the median value (`pivot`), the sorted list of row indices with smaller values (`left`), and the sorted list of row indices with larger values (`right`).\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_split(data: np.ndarray, d: int) -> tuple[int, list[int], list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"Split *data* along column *d* by its median value.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    data : np.ndarray\n        2-D array of shape (n_samples, n_features).\n    d : int\n        Index of the column to use for the split.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    tuple\n        (pivot, left, right) where\n        \u2022 pivot is the row index whose value in column *d* is the median;\n        \u2022 left  is a list of row indices with smaller values;\n        \u2022 right is a list of row indices with larger  values.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_samples = data.shape[0]\n    column = data[:, d]\n    idx_median = np.argpartition(column, n_samples // 2)[n_samples // 2]\n    median_value = column[idx_median]\n    pivot = idx_median\n    \n    left = [i for i in range(n_samples) if column[i] < median_value]\n    right = [i for i in range(n_samples) if column[i] > median_value]\n    \n    left.sort()\n    right.sort()\n    \n    return pivot, left, right\n```"}
{"task_id": 40, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "## Step 1: Understand the task and the requirements\nThe task is to implement a function `to_frames` that takes a 1-D NumPy array `x`, a positive integer `frame_width`, and a positive hop length `stride`, and returns a view on `x` with shape `(n_frames, frame_width)` where `n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1`. The function should use `numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided` to create a view on the original signal without copying it.\n\n## Step 2: Check the pre-conditions\nTo ensure the function works correctly, we need to check the pre-conditions:\n1. `x` is one-dimensional.\n2. `stride` is greater than or equal to 1.\n3. `len(x)` is greater than or equal to `frame_width`.\nWe will use `assert` statements to check these conditions.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate `n_frames`\nWe need to calculate `n_frames` based on the given formula: `n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1`. This will determine the number of rows in the output array.\n\n## Step 4: Use `as_strided` to create the view\n`as_strided` allows us to create a view on `x` with a different shape and strides. The new shape will be `(n_frames, frame_width)`. The stride for the second dimension (columns) remains the same as `x.strides[0]`, which is the stride of `x` since it's a 1-D array. The stride for the first dimension (rows) will be `stride * x.strides[0]`, because we are moving `stride` steps at a time.\n\n## Step 5: Set the writability of the returned view\nThe `writeable` parameter controls whether the returned view is writable. If `writeable` is `False`, the returned array should be read-only. Otherwise, it should inherit the writability of `x`.\n\n## Step 6: Implement the function\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.lib.stride_tricks import as_strided\n\ndef to_frames(x: np.ndarray, frame_width: int, stride: int, writeable: bool = False) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Convert a 1-D signal into overlapping frames.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : np.ndarray\n        One-dimensional input signal of length *N*.\n    frame_width : int\n        The length (*in samples*) of each output frame.\n    stride : int\n        Hop length \u2013 number of samples between the starts of successive frames.\n    writeable : bool, default=False\n        If *False* the returned view is read-only; if *True* it is writeable\n        whenever the source array was writeable.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    np.ndarray\n        A view on *x* with shape ``(n_frames, frame_width)`` where\n        ``n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1``.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check pre-conditions\n    assert x.ndim == 1, \"x must be one-dimensional\"\n    assert stride >= 1, \"stride must be greater than or equal to 1\"\n    assert len(x) >= frame_width, \"len(x) must be greater than or equal to frame_width\"\n\n    # Calculate n_frames\n    n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1\n\n    # Create a view on x using as_strided\n    framed_x = as_strided(x, shape=(n_frames, frame_width), strides=(stride * x.strides[0], x.strides[0]))\n\n    # Set the writability of the returned view\n    framed_x.flags.writeable = writeable and x.flags.writeable\n\n    return framed_x\n```\n\n## Step 7: Verify the implementation\nThe implementation should be verified to ensure it meets all the requirements, including returning a view on the original data, having the correct shape, and adhering to the writability constraint.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.lib.stride_tricks import as_strided\n\ndef to_frames(x: np.ndarray, frame_width: int, stride: int, writeable: bool = False) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Convert a 1-D signal into overlapping frames.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : np.ndarray\n        One-dimensional input signal of length *N*.\n    frame_width : int\n        The length (*in samples*) of each output frame.\n    stride : int\n        Hop length \u2013 number of samples between the starts of successive frames.\n    writeable : bool, default=False\n        If *False* the returned view is read-only; if *True* it is writeable\n        whenever the source array was writeable.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    np.ndarray\n        A view on *x* with shape ``(n_frames, frame_width)`` where\n        ``n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1``.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check pre-conditions\n    assert x.ndim == 1, \"x must be one-dimensional\"\n    assert stride >= 1, \"stride must be greater than or equal to 1\"\n    assert len(x) >= frame_width, \"len(x) must be greater than or equal to frame_width\"\n\n    # Calculate n_frames\n    n_frames = (len(x) - frame_width) // stride + 1\n\n    # Create a view on x using as_strided\n    framed_x = as_strided(x, shape=(n_frames, frame_width), strides=(stride * x.strides[0], x.strides[0]))\n\n    # Set the writability of the returned view\n    framed_x.flags.writeable = writeable and x.flags.writeable\n\n    return framed_x\n```"}

The formula to calculate $\\beta_t(i)$ is given by $\\beta_t(i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{ij} \\, b_j(o_{t+1}) \\, \\beta_{t+1}(j)$, with the initial condition $\\beta_{T-1}(i) = 1$ for all $i$, where $T$ is the length of the observation sequence, $a_{ij}$ is the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$, and $b_j(o_{t+1})$ is the emission probability of observing symbol $o_{t+1}$ in state $j$.\n\n## Step 2: Convert Input Lists to NumPy Arrays for Efficient Computation\nTo efficiently compute the backward probabilities, we first convert the given lists (transition-probability matrix $A$, emission-probability matrix $B$, and observation sequence $obs$) into NumPy arrays. This step is necessary because NumPy arrays provide vectorized operations that are much faster than iterating over Python lists.\n\n## Step 3: Initialize the Backward Probability Vector for the Last Time Step\nWe start by initializing the backward probability vector $\\beta_{T-1}$ for the last time step $T-1$. According to the given formula, $\\beta_{T-1}(i) = 1$ for all states $i$. This means we create a vector of ones with length $N$, where $N$ is the number of states.\n\n## Step 4: Implement the Backward Algorithm Iteratively\nWe then implement the backward algorithm iteratively from $T-2$ down to $t$. At each step $t$, we calculate $\\beta_t(i)$ using the formula $\\beta_t(i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{ij} \\, b_j(o_{t+1}) \\, \\beta_{t+1}(j)$. This involves matrix-vector multiplication and element-wise multiplication with the emission probabilities.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate $\\beta_t$ for the Given $t$\nThe function should return $\\beta_t$ for the given time index $t$. We calculate $\\beta_t$ by iteratively applying the backward algorithm until we reach the desired $t$.\n\n## Step 6: Round the Results to 4 Decimal Places\nFinally, we round the calculated backward probabilities to 4 decimal places as required.\n\n## Step 7: Write the Python Function\nHere's how we can implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef backward_beta(A: list[list[float]], B: list[list[float]], obs: list[int], t: int) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the backward probability vector \u03b2_t for a given time index t in a Hidden Markov Model.\n\n    Parameters:\n    A (list[list[float]]): Transition-probability matrix of shape (N, N)\n    B (list[list[float]]): Emission-probability matrix of shape (N, M)\n    obs (list[int]): List of observation indices (length T)\n    t (int): Integer time index (0 \u2264 t < T)\n\n    Returns:\n    list[float]: A list containing the N backward probabilities rounded to 4 decimal places.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input lists to NumPy arrays\n    A = np.array(A)\n    B = np.array(B)\n    obs = np.array(obs)\n    \n    # Get the number of states (N) and the length of the observation sequence (T)\n    N = A.shape[0]\n    T = len(obs)\n    \n    # Initialize the backward probability vector for the last time step\n    beta = np.ones(N)\n    \n    # Iterate from T-2 down to t\n    for i in range(T-2, t-1, -1):\n        # Calculate beta_i using the formula: beta_i = A * (B[:, obs[i+1]] * beta_{i+1})\n        beta = np.sum(A * (B[:, obs[i+1]] * beta), axis=1)\n    \n    # Return the calculated beta_t rounded to 4 decimal places\n    return np.round(beta, 4).tolist()\n```\n\n## Step 8: Example Usage\nTo use this function, you would call it with the appropriate parameters, like so:\n```python\nA = [[0.7, 0.3], [0.4, 0.6]]  # Transition probabilities\nB = [[0.5, 0.4, 0.1], [0.1, 0.3, 0.6]]  # Emission probabilities\nobs = [0, 1, 2]  # Observation sequence\nt = 1  # Time index\n\nresult = backward_beta(A, B, obs, t)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[0.339, 0.661]}$ (example output, actual output may vary based on input)"}

The HMM is defined by three parameters: the transition matrix $A$, the emission matrix $B$, and the initial state distribution $\\pi$. The observation sequence is given as a list of integers.\n\n## Step 2: Check for Empty Input Lists\nFirst, we need to check if any of the input lists ($A$, $B$, $\\pi$, or $obs$) are empty.

{"task_id": 69, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "## Step 1: Validate the Input Dimensions\nTo start, we need to validate the input dimensions to ensure they are consistent with the requirements of the Hidden Markov Model. This includes checking the lengths and dimensions of the input lists $S$, $A$, $B$, and the list of $observations$. We need to verify that $S$ is a vector of length $n$, $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix, $B$ is an $n \\times m$ matrix, and that the observations are a list of integers.\n\n## Step 2: Convert Input Lists to NumPy Arrays\nWe will convert the input lists to NumPy arrays for easier manipulation. $S$ should be a 1D array, $A$ and $B$ should be 2D arrays.\n\n## Step 3: Check for Empty Observation Sequence\nWe need to check if the $observations$ list is empty. If it is, we should return $-1$ as per the problem statement.\n\n## Step 4: Validate Observation Indices\nWe must verify that each observation index in the $observations$ list is within the valid range $[0, m-1]$, where $m$ is the number of columns in the emission matrix $B$.\n\n## Step 5: Implement the Forward Algorithm\nThe forward algorithm is used to compute the likelihood of an observation sequence given an HMM. It involves calculating the forward probabilities $\\alpha_t(i)$, which represent the probability of being in state $i$ at time $t$ and having observed the first $t$ observations. The algorithm iterates through the observation sequence, updating these probabilities at each step using the initial state probabilities $S$, the state-transition probabilities $A$, and the emission probabilities $B$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the Initial Forward Probabilities\nAt $t = 0$, $\\alpha_0(i) = S[i] \\times B[i][observations[0]]$. This is the probability of being in state $i$ and observing the first observation.\n\n## Step 7: Update Forward Probabilities for Subsequent Observations\nFor $t > 0$, $\\alpha_t(i) = \\sum_{j} \\alpha_{t-1}(j) \\times A[j][i] \\times B[i][observations[t]]$. This step involves summing over all previous states $j$, the probability of being in $j$ at $t-1$, transitioning to $i$, and then emitting the observation at $t$.\n\n## Step 8: Compute the Likelihood of the Observation Sequence\nThe likelihood of the entire observation sequence is the sum of the forward probabilities at the last time step, $\\sum_{i} \\alpha_T(i)$, where $T$ is the length of the observation sequence.\n\n## Step 9: Return the Result\nFinally, we return the computed likelihood rounded to 4 decimal places.

The network uses ReLU activation for all hidden layers and sigmoid activation for the output layer. The function should take the input matrix X and the network parameters as input and return the final activation AL and a cache list.\n\n## Step 2: Initialize Variables and Understand the Network Parameters\nThe network parameters are stored in a dictionary where 'W' and 'b' represent the weights and biases of each layer, respectively. The input matrix X has a shape of (n_x, m), where n_x is the number of input features and m is the number of examples.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the Number of Layers (L) in the Network\nTo iterate through all layers, we need to determine L, the number of layers in the network.

{"task_id": 115, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "## Step 1: Understand the Problem and the Required Functionality\nThe task is to implement a function `logistic_loss_and_gradient` that calculates the average binary cross-entropy loss and its gradient with respect to the weight vector `w` for logistic regression, given a feature matrix `X`, a binary target vector `y`, and a weight vector `w`.\n\n## Step 2: Define the Sigmoid Function\nTo compute the predicted probabilities, we first need to define the sigmoid function, which is given by `\u03c3(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))`, where `z = X \u00b7 w`. The sigmoid function will be used to calculate `p`.\n\n## Step 3: Compute `z` and `p`\nWe need to compute `z = X \u00b7 w` and then `p = \u03c3(z)`. This step involves matrix multiplication between `X` and `w`.\n\n## Step 4: Adjust `p` to Avoid Numerical Issues\nTo avoid numerical issues when computing the logarithm of `p` or `1-p`, we need to ensure that `p` is not exactly 0 or 1. We will clip `p` to be within the range `[\u03b5, 1-\u03b5]`, where `\u03b5 = 1e-20` if it falls outside this range due to the sigmoid function's output being exactly 0 or 1, but since `p` is computed using the sigmoid function, it will naturally be within (0,1). However, we still need to clip it to avoid `log(0)` issues.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the Average Binary Cross-Entropy Loss `J(w)`\nThe loss is given by `J(w) = -1/m * \u03a3 [y * ln(p) + (1-y) * ln(1-p)]`, where `m` is the number of samples. We will compute this using the adjusted `p`.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the Gradient of the Loss `\u2207J(w)`\nThe gradient is given by `\u2207J(w) = 1/m * X^T (p - y)`. This involves matrix multiplication between `X^T` and `(p - y)`.\n\n## Step 7: Implement the Function\nNow, let's put it all together into the `logistic_loss_and_gradient` function.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef logistic_loss_and_gradient(X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, w: np.ndarray) -> tuple[float, list[list[float]]]:\n    \"\"\"Compute binary cross-entropy loss and its gradient for logistic regression.\n\n    Args:\n        X (np.ndarray): Feature matrix of shape (m, n).\n        y (np.ndarray): Binary target vector of shape (m,) or (m, 1).\n        w (np.ndarray): Weight vector of shape (n,) or (n, 1).\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing\n            1.

It first ensures that `w` and `y` are 2D arrays for consistent matrix operations. Then, it computes `z`, `p`, the loss, and the gradient as per the given formulas. It clips `p` to avoid numerical issues and rounds the loss and gradient to 4 decimals before returning them.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef logistic_loss_and_gradient(X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, w: np.ndarray) -> tuple[float, list[list[float]]]:\n    \"\"\"Compute binary cross-entropy loss and its gradient for logistic regression.\n\n    Args:\n        X (np.ndarray): Feature matrix of shape (m, n).\n        y (np.ndarray): Binary target vector of shape (m,) or (m, 1).\n        w (np.ndarray): Weight vector of shape (n,) or (n, 1).\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing\n            1.

We perform eigen-decomposition on `A` using `np.linalg.eigh`, sort the eigen-pairs in descending order of eigenvalues, and select the first `n_components` eigenvectors.\n7.  We apply a deterministic sign fix to the selected eigenvectors by flipping the sign if the first non-zero element is negative.\n8.

{"task_id": 140, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "# Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum number of minutes an agent needs to escape a given $n \\times n$ maze while avoiding fire. The maze is represented as a list of strings where each character can be '.', '#', or 'F'. The agent starts at the upper-left corner (0,0) and wants to reach the lower-right corner $(n-1, n-1)$.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n\n- The maze is a square of size $n \\times n$.\n- Each cell in the maze can be '.', '#', or 'F'.\n- The agent starts at (0,0) and the goal is to reach $(n-1, n-1)$.\n- Fire spreads to neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) in one minute.\n- The agent can move to neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) in one minute.\n- The agent cannot enter a cell that is on fire or will be on fire when the agent arrives.\n- The start or goal cell may already be on fire, in which case the answer is -1.\n- If the maze has size $1 \\times 1$ and the single cell is '.', the answer is 0.\n- There can be multiple initial fire sources.\n\nInput: A list of strings representing the maze.\nOutput: The minimum number of minutes required for the agent to escape the maze without entering a burning cell, or -1 if it's impossible.\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n\n- The fire spreads first, then the agent moves.\n- The agent can only enter a cell that is not on fire at the moment of arrival.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n1. **Simulate the spread of fire**: First, we need to simulate how the fire spreads through the maze over time. This can be done using a BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm to track when each cell will be on fire.\n\n2. **Track time of fire spread**: For each cell, we need to know the time at which it will be on fire. This information is crucial for the agent to decide whether it can safely move into a cell.\n\n3. **Agent's BFS with fire time check**: The agent should also use a BFS algorithm to explore the maze. However, the agent must check the time it will take to reach a cell against the time that cell will be on fire.\n\n4. **Check if a cell is safe for the agent**: A cell is safe for the agent if it's not on fire at the time the agent arrives. This means the agent's arrival time must be less than the fire's arrival time at that cell.\n\n5. **Handle edge cases**: We need to handle cases where the start or goal cell is already on fire, or if the maze size is $1 \\times 1$.\n\n6. **Optimization**: Using BFS for both fire spread and agent movement ensures that we find the shortest path (in terms of time) for both processes, which is essential for determining the minimum time required for the agent to escape.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. **Calculate fire spread time**: Perform a BFS from all initial fire sources to calculate the time at which each cell will be on fire. Store this information in a separate grid, `fire_time`.\n\n2. **Check if start or goal is on fire**: Immediately return -1 if the start (0,0) or goal $(n-1, n-1)$ cell is on fire at time 0.\n\n3. **Perform agent's BFS**: Start a BFS from the agent's starting position (0,0) at time 0. For each cell the agent considers moving into, check if the agent's arrival time is less than the fire's arrival time at that cell. If so, it's safe to move into that cell.\n\n4. **Explore neighbors and track time**: Explore neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) of the current cell, and track the time taken to reach each new cell. Use a queue to manage the BFS.\n\n5. **Return minimum time or -1**: If the agent successfully reaches the goal, return the time taken. If the agent cannot reach the goal without entering a burning cell, return -1.\n\n6. **Handle special case for $1 \\times 1$ maze**: If the maze size is $1 \\times 1$ and the cell is '.', return 0 as the agent is already at the goal.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef escape_fire_maze(grid: list[str]) -> int:\n    n = len(grid)\n    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n    \n    # Calculate fire time\n    fire_time = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    fire_queue = deque()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == 'F':\n                fire_queue.append((i, j))\n                fire_time[i][j] = 0\n    \n    while fire_queue:\n        x, y = fire_queue.popleft()\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] != '#' and fire_time[nx][ny] > fire_time[x][y] + 1:\n                fire_time[nx][ny] = fire_time[x][y] + 1\n                fire_queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    # Check if start or goal is on fire\n    if grid[0][0] == 'F' or grid[n-1][n-1] == 'F':\n        return -1\n    \n    # Agent's BFS\n    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    agent_queue = deque([(0, 0, 0)])  # x, y, time\n    visited[0][0] = True\n    \n    while agent_queue:\n        x, y, time = agent_queue.popleft()\n        if x == n - 1 and y == n - 1:\n            return time\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] != '#' and not visited[nx][ny] and time + 1 < fire_time[nx][ny]:\n                agent_queue.append((nx, ny, time + 1))\n                visited[nx][ny] = True\n    \n    return -1\n```"}

The network has two hidden layers followed by a tanh output layer. The function `actor_forward` should take a state vector and a dictionary of weights as input and return the resulting action vector.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the input state to a NumPy array for easier manipulation\nTo perform the necessary operations, we first need to convert the input `state` into a NumPy array. This is because NumPy arrays are more suitable for numerical computations.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the first affine transformation (Linear(W1, b1)) and apply ReLU activation\nThe first step in the forward pass is to perform the affine transformation using `W1` and `b1`, followed by ReLU activation. This involves matrix multiplication between the state vector and `W1`, adding `b1`, and then applying the ReLU function.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the second affine transformation (Linear(W2, b2)) and apply ReLU activation\nAfter the first layer, we perform another affine transformation using `W2` and `b2`, followed by ReLU activation.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the third affine transformation (Linear(W3, b3)) and apply tanh activation\nThe final affine transformation is done using `W3` and `b3`, followed by tanh activation to produce the action vector.\n\n## Step 6: Round the resulting action vector to four decimal places and return it as a list\nThe final action vector needs to be rounded to four decimal places and returned as a Python list.\n\n## Step 7: Implement the solution in Python\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef actor_forward(state, weights: dict) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Perform the forward pass of a two-hidden-layer actor network.\n\n    The network architecture is:  Linear \u2192 ReLU \u2192 Linear \u2192 ReLU \u2192 Linear \u2192 tanh.\n\n    Args:\n        state (list[float] | np.ndarray): 1-D vector representing the state.\n        weights (dict): Dictionary with NumPy arrays under the keys\n            'W1', 'b1', 'W2', 'b2', 'W3', 'b3'.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[float]: Action vector (each component rounded to 4 decimals).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the state to a NumPy array\n    state = np.array(state)\n    \n    # First affine transformation and ReLU activation\n    hidden1 = np.maximum(np.dot(state, weights['W1']) + weights['b1'], 0)\n    \n    # Second affine transformation and ReLU activation\n    hidden2 = np.maximum(np.dot(hidden1, weights['W2']) + weights['b2'], 0)\n    \n    # Third affine transformation and tanh activation\n    action = np.tanh(np.dot(hidden2, weights['W3']) + weights['b3'])\n    \n    # Round the action to four decimal places and return as a list\n    return np.round(action, 4).tolist()\n```\n\n## Step 8: Verify that the implementation matches the given constraints and requirements\nThe implementation uses NumPy for numerical computations, performs the required affine transformations and nonlinear activations, and returns the action vector rounded to four decimal places as a Python list.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef actor_forward(state, weights: dict) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Perform the forward pass of a two-hidden-layer actor network.\n\n    The network architecture is:  Linear \u2192 ReLU \u2192 Linear \u2192 ReLU \u2192 Linear \u2192 tanh.\n\n    Args:\n        state (list[float] | np.ndarray): 1-D vector representing the state.\n        weights (dict): Dictionary with NumPy arrays under the keys\n            'W1', 'b1', 'W2', 'b2', 'W3', 'b3'.\n\n    Returns:\n        list[float]: Action vector (each component rounded to 4 decimals).\n    \"\"\"\n    state = np.array(state)\n    hidden1 = np.maximum(np.dot(state, weights['W1']) + weights['b1'], 0)\n    hidden2 = np.maximum(np.dot(hidden1, weights['W2']) + weights['b2'], 0)\n    action = np.tanh(np.dot(hidden2, weights['W3']) + weights['b3'])\n    return np.round(action, 4).tolist()\n```"}

It then determines the number of nearest neighbours `k` to consider, ensuring it does not exceed the number of training samples.\n* For each test sample in `X_test`, the function computes the Euclidean distance to all training samples in `X_train` using `np.linalg.norm`. It then identifies the `k` nearest neighbours by sorting these distances and selecting the corresponding indices `k_indices`.\n* The function makes predictions based on the task type.

It first checks if the `name` is one of the supported metrics. If not, it returns a lambda function that always returns -1.\n*   The code defines four distance functions (`euclidean`, `manhattan`, `chebyshev`, `cosine`) and maps them to the corresponding metric names using a dictionary `distance_functions`.\n*   A validation function `validate` checks if the input vectors `x` and `y` are valid (i.e., they are lists, tuples, or NumPy arrays that can be converted to float, are one-dimensional, non-empty, and have the same length).\n*   The `validated_distance` function returned by the `metric` factory checks the validity of the input vectors using the `validate` function and computes the distance using the selected distance function. If the validation fails or if the metric is 'cosine' and either of the vectors has a zero norm, it returns -1."}

The function must distinguish between continuous and discrete spaces.\n2. It must handle both single- and multi-dimensional cases.\n3. The function should return three values: `n_actions_per_dim`, `action_ids`, and `action_dim`.\n4. `n_actions_per_dim` is a list whose i-th element is the number of distinct actions in dimension i; `math.inf` (or `numpy.inf`) should be used for continuous dimensions.\n5. `action_ids` is a list containing every valid discrete action (cartesian product of all dimensions) or `None` when at least one dimension is continuous.\n6. `action_dim` is the total number of action dimensions.\n7. The environment is assumed to expose its action space in a way that mimics OpenAI Gym.\n8. The function must not mutate its inputs.\n\nInput: `env`, `md_action`, `cont_action`\nOutput: `n_actions_per_dim`, `action_ids`, `action_dim`\n\nSubtle requirements:\n\n1. If the action space is continuous in any dimension, the corresponding entries in `n_actions_per_dim` should be set to `numpy.inf`, and `action_ids` should be `None`.\n2. When the space is fully discrete and multi-dimensional, `action_ids` must contain all possible actions represented as tuples, obtained via the cartesian product of the ranges for each dimension.\n\n# Key Insights\n\n1. The problem requires handling different types of action spaces (continuous vs. discrete, single- vs. multi-dimensional).\n2. The `env` object exposes its action space in a way that mimics OpenAI Gym, which provides a standard interface for accessing action space properties.\n3. The `md_action` and `cont_action` Boolean indicators provide crucial information about the action space structure.\n4. To compute `n_actions_per_dim`, we need to iterate over each dimension of the action space and determine the number of distinct actions.\n5. For `action_ids`, we need to compute the cartesian product of the ranges for each dimension if the space is discrete; otherwise, it should be `None`.\n6. `action_dim` can be determined based on the `md_action` indicator and the properties of the action space.\n7. The function should handle both discrete and continuous action spaces, as well as single- and multi-dimensional cases.\n\nCritical examples or test cases that led to insights:\n\n1. A discrete, single-dimensional action space (e.g., `env.action_space.n = 5`).\n2. A continuous, single-dimensional action space (e.g., `env.action_space.shape = (3,)`).\n3. A multi-dimensional discrete action space (e.g., `env.action_space.spaces = [Discrete(3), Discrete(4)]`).\n4. A multi-dimensional continuous action space (e.g., `env.action_space.shape = (2, 3)`).\n\n# Solution Strategy\n\n1. Check if the action space is multi-dimensional (`md_action` is `True`).\n2.

It then enters a loop where it attempts to reduce the total clustering cost by swapping any current medoid with any non-medoid sample.\n*   The `calculate_cost` function is used to compute the total cost, which is the sum of the Euclidean distances between every sample and the medoid of the cluster it belongs to.\n*   The algorithm iterates through all possible swaps between a medoid and a non-medoid sample, and it accepts the swap that results in the largest reduction in the total cost. This process continues until no swap can further decrease the cost.\n*   Finally, the function assigns each sample to the closest medoid based on the final set of medoids obtained after convergence and returns the cluster labels as a Python list."}

The `mean_squared_log_error` function first validates the inputs by checking if they have the same shape/length and contain only non-negative values. If the inputs are invalid, it returns -1.\n3.  If the inputs are valid, it calls the `squared_log_error` function to calculate the element-wise squared logarithmic errors and then computes the mean of these errors using NumPy's `mean` function.\n4.

The function first checks if the input `shape` has at least 2 dimensions. If not, it returns `-1`.\n2.  It then creates a 2-D matrix `A` with shape `(d0, d1*...*dn)` filled with i.i.d. samples from the standard normal distribution using `np.random.normal`.\n3.  The SVD of `A` is computed using `np.linalg.svd` with `full_matrices=False` to obtain the matrices `U`, `\u03a3`, and `V\u1d40`. The `full_matrices=False` argument ensures that `U` and `V\u1d40` are the correct shapes for the subsequent steps.\n4.  The function then chooses the SVD factor that has the same size as `A` by comparing the shapes of `U` and `A`. If they match, it assigns `U` to `Q`; otherwise, it assigns `V\u1d40` to `Q`.\n5.  `Q` is then reshaped back to the original `shape` using `np.reshape` and scaled by the given `scale` factor.\n6.  Finally, the function returns the resulting tensor as a Python list using the `tolist` method.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\nnp.random.seed(0)\nshape = (2, 2)\nscale = 0.5\nresult = orthogonal(shape, scale)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```python\n[[0.2590445471197694, 0.4261624821452039], [0.4261624821452039, -0.2600368879865514]]\n```"}

If a vertex has no neighbours, its entry in `G` should be an empty list.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- `V` contains unique vertex identifiers.\n- Vertices can be of any hashable type (e.g., `int`, `str`).\n- The order in `V` must be preserved in the returned structure.\n- `E` contains 2-tuples representing undirected edges.\n- Every neighbour in `G[i]` must appear exactly once.\n- The neighbours inside each `G[i]` must be sorted according to their order of appearance in `V`.\n- If a vertex has no neighbours, its entry in `G` must be an empty list.\n\nInput: `V` (list of unique vertex identifiers), `E` (list of 2-tuples representing undirected edges).\nOutput: `G` (list of lists representing the adjacency list).\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n- The order of the outer list `G` must follow the order of `V`.\n- The order inside each inner list `G[i]` must follow the order of appearance in `V`.\n\n# Key Insights\n- To efficiently look up the index of a vertex in `V`, creating a dictionary that maps each vertex to its index is necessary.\n- Since the graph is undirected, for every edge `(u, v)` in `E`, both `u` should be added to the adjacency list of `v` and `v` should be added to the adjacency list of `u`.\n- Using a set to store neighbours for each vertex can automatically remove duplicate neighbours.\n- The neighbours in each `G[i]` need to be sorted based on their order of appearance in `V`, which can be achieved by using the index of the vertices in `V` as a sorting key.\n- Initializing `G` with empty lists for each vertex in `V` ensures that every vertex is represented in the output, even if it has no neighbours.\n- The use of a dictionary to store the index of each vertex in `V` allows for efficient lookups.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n1. Create a dictionary `vertex_to_index` that maps each vertex in `V` to its index. This is done to efficiently look up the index of a vertex when processing edges.\n2. Initialize `G` with empty lists for each vertex in `V`. This ensures that every vertex is represented in the output.\n3. Process each edge `(u, v)` in `E`. For each edge, add `v` to the set of neighbours of `u` and `u` to the set of neighbours of `v`, using `vertex_to_index` to find the indices of `u` and `v` in `V`.\n4. After processing all edges, for each vertex `v` in `V`, sort its neighbours based on their order of appearance in `V` and store the sorted list in `G`.\n5. To sort the neighbours, use the index of the vertices in `V` as the sorting key. This ensures that the neighbours in each `G[i]` are in the correct order.\n6. Return `G`, which now contains the adjacency list representation of the graph, with every neighbour appearing exactly once and in the correct order.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, List, Tuple\n\ndef build_adj_list(V: List[Any], E: List[Tuple[Any, Any]]) -> List[List[Any]]:\n    \"\"\"Convert an undirected graph given by (V, E) to an adjacency list.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    V : List[Any]\n        A list of *unique* vertex identifiers.

Then, check if `window_len` == 1 and return `[1.0]` if true.\n\n2. **Determine N**: Calculate $N$ based on whether the window is symmetric or periodic. For symmetric, $N = window_len - 1$. For periodic, $N = window_len$.\n\n3. **Generate n Values**: Generate an array of $n$ values from 0 to `window_len - 1`.\n\n4. **Compute Blackman\u2013Harris Window Coefficients**: Use the formula to compute the window coefficients using the given coefficients $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3$ and the generated $n$ values.\n\n5. **Round the Coefficients**: Round the computed coefficients to four decimal places.\n\n6. **Return as List**: Return the rounded coefficients as a Python list.\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef blackman_harris(window_len: int, symmetric: bool = False) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Generate a Blackman\u2013Harris window.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    window_len : int\n        Desired number of samples in the returned window.\n    symmetric : bool, optional (default=False)\n        If False, return the *periodic* form suitable for an FFT of length\n        `window_len`.

This can be achieved using `numpy.argmax` if the `value` is a numpy array, or by using the `index` method in combination with the `max` function if it's a list or tuple.\n\n## Step 4: Implement the logic for regression\nFor regression, we simply need to return the `value` attribute of the `Leaf` object as it is.\n\n## Step 5: Write the Python code for the `leaf_predict` function\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass Leaf:\n    \"\"\"Simple container class for a tree leaf.\n\n    Args:\n        value: Either a list/tuple of class probabilities (for classification)\n               or a scalar representing the regional mean (for regression).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n\n\ndef leaf_predict(leaf: \"Leaf\", classifier: bool):\n    \"\"\"Return the prediction stored in a decision-tree leaf.\n\n    Args:\n        leaf: A `Leaf` object whose `value` attribute is either a sequence of\n              class probabilities (classification) or a single number\n              (regression).\n        classifier: When *True* treat the leaf as belonging to a\n                     classification tree; otherwise treat it as regression.\n\n    Returns:\n        int | float: Predicted class index for classification; otherwise the\n                     raw scalar stored in the leaf.\n    \"\"\"\n    if classifier:\n        # Check if the value is a sequence (list or tuple) or a numpy array\n        if isinstance(leaf.value, (list, tuple, np.ndarray)):\n            # Return the index of the maximum probability\n            return np.argmax(leaf.value)\n        else:\n            # If not a sequence, raise an error as it's not a valid input for classification\n            raise ValueError(\"For classification, leaf.value must be a sequence of probabilities.\")\n    else:\n        # For regression, return the scalar value\n        if isinstance(leaf.value, (int, float)):\n            return leaf.value\n        else:\n            # If not a scalar, raise an error as it's not a valid input for regression\n            raise ValueError(\"For regression, leaf.value must be a scalar.\")\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Classification example\n    classification_leaf = Leaf([0.2, 0.3, 0.5])\n    print(leaf_predict(classification_leaf, True))  # Output: 2\n    \n    # Regression example\n    regression_leaf = Leaf(10.5)\n    print(leaf_predict(regression_leaf, False))  # Output: 10.5\n```\n\n## Step 6: Validate the code with example usage\nThe provided example usage demonstrates how to use the `leaf_predict` function for both classification and regression scenarios."}

The function `kmeans` takes in a 2-D NumPy array `data`, an integer `K`, and an optional integer `max_iters`.\n2.  It first checks if `K` equals 1. If so, it returns a list containing the mean of the entire dataset as the single centroid.\n3.  The function initializes the `K` centroids with the first `K` samples in the `data` matrix.\n4.  It then enters a loop that runs for at most `max_iters` iterations.\n5.  Inside the loop, it calculates the Euclidean distance between each sample and the centroids, assigning each sample to the closest centroid.\n6.  The centroids are then recomputed as the mean of the samples currently assigned to them. If a centroid loses all its samples, it remains unchanged.\n7.  The loop checks for convergence by comparing the old and new centroids. If the difference is within a tolerance of 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076, the loop breaks.\n8.  After the loop, the function sorts the final centroids lexicographically, rounds every coordinate to four decimals, and returns them as a plain Python list of lists.\n\n**Output**\n\nFor the given example, the output will be:\n\n```python\n[[1.3333, 1.3333], [8.3333, 8.3333]]\n```"}

We stack these arrays into a single NumPy array `updates_array` along a new axis using `np.stack(updates, axis=-1)`. This allows us to perform vectorized operations on all updates simultaneously.\n\n2. **Calculating Scaled Updates Sum**: We calculate the sum of the updates scaled by the `learning_rate`. This is done by multiplying `updates_array` with `learning_rate` and then summing along the last axis (`axis=-1`) using `np.sum(updates_array * learning_rate, axis=-1)`.\n\n3. **Initializing Running Prediction**: The `running_pred` is initialized as the negative of the `scaled_updates_sum`. This is because the problem states that each tree's output is subtracted from the running prediction.\n\n4. **Regression**: If `regression` is `True`, we simply return `running_pred` rounded to 4 decimal places using `np.round(running_pred, 4)`.\n\n5. **Classification**: If `regression` is `False`, we perform the following steps:\n   - Apply the softmax function to `running_pred` to obtain class probabilities. We first subtract the maximum value along the last axis (`axis=-1`) to prevent overflow.\n   - Calculate the predicted class labels by taking the argmax of the probabilities along the last axis (`axis=-1`) using `np.argmax(probabilities, axis=-1)`.\n\n6. **Return**: The function returns the predicted values. For regression, it's a 1-D array of floats rounded to 4 decimals. For classification, it's a 1-D array of integers representing the predicted class labels."}

Calculate the frequency ($n_c$) of each class using the counts returned by a suitable method (e.g., `np.bincount()` if the labels are non-negative integers, or an alternative approach for more general cases).\n5. Compute the relative frequency ($p_c$) of each class by dividing their frequencies ($n_c$) by the total number of samples ($N$).\n6.

The `gbdt_regression` function initializes the predictions with the mean of `y_train`.\n2.  It iterates `n_estimators` times, computing the residuals (negative gradients of the squared-error loss) at each step.\n3.  A regression tree is fit to the residuals using the `RegressionTree` class.\n4.  The predictions for both the training data and the test data are updated using the regression tree's predictions and the learning rate.\n5.  Finally, the function returns the final predictions for the test data, rounded to 4 decimal places, as a Python list.\n\nThe `RegressionTree` class is a basic implementation of a regression tree. It includes methods for growing the tree, making predictions, and traversing the tree.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `gbdt_regression` function with random data."}

The function `multivariate_gaussian_pdf` takes in three parameters: `X`, `mean`, and `cov`, representing the data points, mean vector, and covariance matrix, respectively.\n2.  It first checks if `X` is a one-dimensional array and reshapes it to a 2D array if necessary.\n3.  The determinant of the covariance matrix is calculated using `np.linalg.det`. If the determinant is zero, it indicates that the covariance matrix is singular, and a `ValueError` is raised.\n4.  The inverse of the covariance matrix is computed using `np.linalg.inv`.\n5.  The function then iterates over each data point in `X`, calculates the difference between the data point and the mean vector, and computes the exponent term using the inverse of the covariance matrix.\n6.  The PDF value is calculated using the formula for the multivariate Gaussian distribution, and the result is rounded to four decimal places and appended to the `pdf_values` list.\n7.  Finally, the function returns the list of PDF values.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `multivariate_gaussian_pdf` function to evaluate the PDF values for a set of data points given a mean vector and covariance matrix. The output is a list of PDF values rounded to four decimal places."}

However, the problem statement implies that this formula might need to be adjusted or understood in the context of `m` classes.\n- For `m` classes, the x-coordinate generation rule depends on `floor(i/2)`, which means that the x-coordinate range will be the same for consecutive classes (e.g., class 0 and 1, class 2 and 3, etc.).\n- The given formula for the label suggests a binary classification problem.

This ensures that the moments are properly initialized for the Adam update step.\n* It then computes the new first moment `m_new` and second moment `v_new` using the given formulae: `m_new = b1 * m_prev + (1 - b1) * grad` and `v_new = b2 * v_prev + (1 - b2) * grad\u00b2`. The `np.square(grad)` is used to compute `grad\u00b2`.\n* The bias-corrected moments `m_hat` and `v_hat` are computed by dividing `m_new` and `v_new` by `(1 - b1 ** t)` and `(1 - b2 ** t)`, respectively. These corrected moments are then used to update the parameters `w` to obtain `w_new`.\n* Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the updated parameters `w_new`, the new first moment `m_new`, and the new second moment `v_new`, all of which have the same shape as the corresponding input parameters."}

It takes a 2D NumPy array `data` and parameters `eps` and `min_samples` as input and returns a list of cluster labels for each sample in `data`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: The function starts by checking if the input `data` is empty. If so, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it initializes a list `labels` with -1 for each data point, indicating that they are initially considered noise.\n2.  **DBSCAN Clustering**: The algorithm then iterates over each data point. If a point is already labeled (i.e., not -1), it skips to the next point. For each unlabeled point, it calculates the neighbors within the `eps` radius using the `get_neighbors` function.\n3.  **Core Point Identification**: If a point has at least `min_samples` neighbors, it's considered a core point. The algorithm labels this core point with the current `cluster_id` and expands the cluster using the `expand_cluster` function.\n4.  **Cluster Expansion**: The `expand_cluster` function is a recursive process that labels all density-connected points with the same `cluster_id`. It uses a stack to keep track of points to visit. For each point, it checks if it's a core point and, if so, adds its neighbors to the stack. This process continues until all reachable points are labeled.\n5.  **Labeling**: The algorithm assigns a unique `cluster_id` to each cluster, starting from 0 and incrementing for each new cluster discovered.

This allows for easier manipulation of the input data.\n* It then checks if `num_classes` is provided. If not, it infers the number of classes from the maximum label in `y` plus one. If `num_classes` is provided, it validates that all labels in `y` are within the range `[0, num_classes)`, raising a `ValueError` if any label is out of range.\n* The function creates a matrix `categorical` filled with zeros, with shape `(len(y), num_classes)` and dtype `int`. It then uses advanced indexing to set the appropriate elements to 1, effectively one-hot encoding the labels.\n* Finally, the function returns the `categorical` matrix, which represents the one-hot encoding of the input labels."}

The function `compute_cost` takes two NumPy arrays `AL` and `Y` as input, representing the model probabilities and true labels, respectively.\n2. It checks if `AL` and `Y` have the same shape and raises a `ValueError` if they do not.\n3. The number of training examples `m` is determined by the size of `AL`.\n4. The probabilities in `AL` are clipped to the range `[1e-15, 1 - 1e-15]` to avoid numerical overflow when taking the logarithm.\n5. The binary cross-entropy cost is computed using the formula `J = \u2212 1\u2044m \u00b7 \u03a3 [ y\u00b7ln(a) + (1\u2212y)\u00b7ln(1\u2212a) ]`.\n6. The cost is returned as a Python `float`.\n7. In the example usage, we demonstrate how to use the `compute_cost` function with sample model probabilities and true labels, and print the result rounded to 4 decimal places."}

The HMM is defined by its parameters: initial distribution $\\pi$, transition matrix $A$, and emission matrix $B$. The function takes as input the HMM parameters, a sequence of observations $O$, and a time index $t$.\n\n## Step 2: Check if Time Index $t$ is Within the Valid Range\nThe function should first check if $t$ is within the range $[0, len(observations) - 1]$. If $t$ is outside this range, the function should return an empty list.\n\n## Step 3: Compute Forward Probabilities $\\alpha$\nTo compute $\\alpha_t(i)$, which is the probability of the partial observation sequence up to $t$ and being in state $i$ at $t$, we use the forward algorithm. The forward algorithm initializes $\\alpha_0(i) = \\pi_i \\cdot B_{i, O_0}$ and then iteratively computes $\\alpha_{t+1}(j) = \\sum_{i} \\alpha_t(i) \\cdot A_{i, j} \\cdot B_{j, O_{t+1}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Compute Backward Probabilities $\\beta$\nTo compute $\\beta_t(i)$, which is the probability of the remaining observation sequence from $t+1$ given that the state at $t$ is $i$, we use the backward algorithm. The backward algorithm initializes $\\beta_{T-1}(i) = 1$ for all $i$, where $T = len(observations)$, and then iteratively computes $\\beta_t(i) = \\sum_{j} A_{i, j} \\cdot B_{j, O_{t+1}} \\cdot \\beta_{t+1}(j)$.\n\n## Step 5: Combine $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ to Obtain $\\gamma_t$\n$\\gamma_t(i) = \\frac{\\alpha_t(i) \\cdot \\beta_t(i)}{\\sum_j \\alpha_t(j) \\cdot \\beta_t(j)}$.

The mixture weights should sum to 1, the means should be random points from the data or within the data range, and the covariance matrices should be positive semi-definite.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the Expectation (E) step\nIn the E-step, we calculate the responsibility of each component for each data point. This involves computing the probability of each data point under each Gaussian component and then normalizing these probabilities to obtain the responsibility of each component for each data point.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the Maximization (M) step\nIn the M-step, we update the parameters (mixture weights, means, and covariance matrices) of the Gaussian components based on the responsibilities calculated in the E-step. The new mixture weights are the average responsibilities of each component across all data points. The new means are calculated as the weighted average of the data points, where the weights are the responsibilities.

The function takes a data matrix X and a 1-D label vector y as input, where X contains discrete feature values encoded as non-negative integers starting from 0, and y contains integer class labels starting from 0.\n\nKey constraints and edge cases:\n- X is a 2-D array of shape (n_samples, n_features) containing discrete feature values.\n- y is a 1-D array of shape (n_samples,) containing integer class labels.\n- The feature values and class labels are non-negative integers starting from 0.\n- If two or more features obtain the same (maximal) information gain, the smallest column index must be returned.\n- The function must return a tuple `(best_feature_index, max_information_gain)` where the gain is rounded to 6 decimal places.\n\nInput: X (np.ndarray), y (np.ndarray)\nOutput: tuple[int, float]\n\nSubtle requirements or implicit constraints:\n- The input data is assumed to be valid, i.e., X and y are np.ndarray objects with the correct shape and data type.\n- The function does not need to handle cases where X or y is empty.\n\n# Key Insights\n- To solve this problem, we need to calculate the information gain for each feature in X with respect to the class label y.\n- The information gain of a feature A is defined as IG(A) = H(y) - H(y|A), where H(y) is the entropy of the label distribution and H(y|A) is the conditional entropy obtained after splitting by the values of A.\n- We need to calculate the entropy H(y) of the label distribution.\n- For each feature A, we need to calculate the conditional entropy H(y|A) after splitting by the values of A.\n- The conditional entropy H(y|A) can be calculated by iterating over the possible values of A, calculating the probability of each value, and then calculating the entropy of the label distribution conditioned on each value.\n- We need to iterate over all features in X, calculate the information gain for each feature, and keep track of the feature with the maximum information gain.\n- If two or more features have the same maximum information gain, we need to return the smallest column index.\n\nCritical examples or test cases:\n- An example with X = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]) and y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0]) is used to verify the implementation.\n\n# Solution Strategy\n1. Calculate the entropy H(y) of the label distribution using the formula H(y) = - \u2211 (p * log2(p)), where p is the probability of each class label.\n2. Iterate over all features in X. For each feature A:\n   - Calculate the conditional entropy H(y|A) by iterating over the possible values of A, calculating the probability of each value, and then calculating the entropy of the label distribution conditioned on each value.\n   - Calculate the information gain IG(A) = H(y) - H(y|A).\n   - Keep track of the feature with the maximum information gain.\n3.

We use the `@` operator for matrix multiplication and the `*` operator for element-wise multiplication.\n2. We then compute the bias term `b` using the formula `b = (1/n) * \u03a3(y_i - w^T x_i)`, where `n` is the number of samples. We use `np.mean` to compute the mean of the values `y_i - w^T x_i`.\n3. We round the weight vector `w` and bias term `b` to 4 decimal places using a list comprehension and the `round` function.\n4. We convert the NumPy array `w` to a Python list `w_list` using the `tolist` method. If `w` is a scalar (i.e., `X` has one feature), we ensure that `w_list` is a list by wrapping the scalar value in a list.\n5.

The function `local_outlier_factor` takes in the input dataset `data`, the number of nearest neighbors `k`, and an optional parameter `epsilon` for outlier detection.\n2.  It first computes the full pair-wise Euclidean distance matrix using NumPy's vectorized operations.\n3.  Then, it calculates the k-distance for each sample by sorting the distance matrix and selecting the k-th nearest neighbor's distance.\n4.  The index list of k nearest neighbors for each sample is obtained by sorting the distance matrix and taking the indices of the k nearest neighbors.\n5.  The reachability distance between two points is defined as the maximum of the k-distance of the second point and the Euclidean distance between the two points. This is computed for all pairs of points.\n6.  The Local Reachability Density (LRD) is calculated for each sample by summing the reachability distances to its k nearest neighbors and taking the reciprocal.\n7.  Finally, the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is computed for each sample by comparing its LRD to the LRD of its k nearest neighbors.\n8.  The LOF scores are rounded to four decimals, and samples with LOF scores greater than `epsilon` are identified as outliers.\n9.  The function returns a tuple containing the list of LOF scores and the list of indices of outlier samples, sorted in ascending order."}

The function `kmeans_centroids` takes a 2D NumPy array `X`, an integer `k`, and an optional `max_iters` parameter.\n2.  It initializes the centroids with the first `k` samples of `X`.\n3.  The algorithm iterates until convergence or `max_iters` is reached. In each iteration, it assigns every sample to the nearest centroid based on the squared Euclidean distance.\n4.  The centroids are updated to the mean of the samples assigned to them. If a cluster becomes empty, its centroid remains unchanged.\n5.  The algorithm checks for convergence by comparing the difference between the new and old centroids. If all centroids move less than `1e-4`, it stops early.\n6.  Finally, the centroids are sorted in ascending lexicographical order, rounded to 4 decimal places, and returned as a list of lists.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `kmeans_centroids` function with random data and print the resulting centroids."}
