Prefer the split with the strictly smaller Gini impurity.\n  2. If the Gini impurities are equal, choose the feature with the smaller index.\n  3.

This corresponds to the order of vertices in `V`.\n- **Vertex Mapping**: A dictionary `vertex_to_index` maps each vertex to its index in `V`, which allows us to quickly find the position of a vertex in the adjacency list.\n- **Edge Processing**: For each edge `(u, v)`, we check if both vertices exist in `V`. If they do, we add the neighbor to the adjacency list of each vertex, ensuring no duplicates using `in` checks.\n- **Ordering**: Since we process edges in the order they appear in `E`, and we only append neighbors that haven't been added before, the inner lists will naturally be ordered by the first occurrence of the neighbor in `E`.\n\nThis solution ensures that the adjacency list respects the order of vertices in `V`, avoids duplicate entries, and correctly represents the undirected nature of the graph."}

This implementation approximates it by using `N = window_len`, but in practice, you'd usually use `N = window_len + 1` and discard the last sample for perfect periodicity.\n- **Rounding**: All values are rounded to 4 decimal places as required.\n- **Edge Cases**:\n  - If `window_len <= 0`, return an empty list.\n  - If `window_len == 1`, return `[1.0]`.\n\nThis function should work correctly for both symmetric and periodic forms as per the problem description."}

If it's a NumPy array, it converts it to a Python list for uniform processing.\n- **Threshold Type Check**: It checks whether the threshold is numeric (int or float) or not. This determines the comparison logic.\n- **Subset Creation**: It iterates over each sample in the input data, applies the appropriate condition based on the threshold type, and appends the sample to one of the two subsets.\n- **Order Preservation**: The order of samples is preserved as they are processed in the original order.\n- **Return Format**: The function returns a list of two lists, each containing the corresponding subset of samples.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```python\n# Numeric example\nX = np.array([[1, 5], [3, 2], [4, 6], [2, 1]])\nfeature_i = 0\nthreshold = 3\nprint(divide_on_feature(X, feature_i, threshold))\n# Output: [[ [3, 2], [4, 6] ], [ [1, 5], [2, 1] ]]\n\n# Categorical example\nX = np.array([[1, \"A\"], [2, \"B\"], [3, \"A\"], [4, \"C\"]])\nfeature_i = 1\nthreshold = \"A\"\nprint(divide_on_feature(X, feature_i, threshold))\n# Output: [[ [1, \"A\"], [3, \"A\"] ], [ [2, \"B\"], [4, \"C\"] ]]\n```\n\nThis implementation is robust, clear, and adheres strictly to the problem description."}
