We start by choosing the initial cluster centres as the first `k` samples of the input array.\n2.  We then assign every sample to its nearest centre using the squared Euclidean distance.\n3.  We recompute each centre as the arithmetic mean of all samples currently assigned to it. If a cluster becomes empty, we re-initialise its centre with a random sample from the dataset.\n4.  We check for convergence by calculating the maximum change of any centre between two consecutive iterations. If the maximum change is smaller than `epsilon`, we stop the algorithm.\n5.  Finally, we round every coordinate of every centre to 4 decimal places and return them together with the list of cluster labels for the samples.\n\nYou can test the function with a sample dataset, for example:\n```python\ndata = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0], [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]])\nk = 2\nepsilon = 1e-3\nmax_iter = 2000\n\ncentres, labels = kmeans(data, k, epsilon, max_iter)\nprint(centres)\nprint(labels)\n```\nThis should output the cluster centres and labels for the given dataset."}

We first generate the integer part of the tensor using `np.random.randint(-300, 300, size=np.prod(shape))`. This generates an array of integers in the desired range, with the same shape as the desired output tensor.\n2. We reshape the integer array to match the desired shape using `offset.reshape(shape)`.\n3. We generate the real part of the tensor using `np.random.rand(*shape)`, which generates an array of random real numbers in the half-open interval [0, 1).\n4. We combine the integer and real parts using element-wise addition, `offset + u`.\n5. If `standardize` is `True`, we standardize each column of the tensor by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. We add a small constant `np.finfo(float).eps` to the denominator to avoid division by zero.\n6.

We then compute the Gaussian kernel matrix by exponentiating the negative of the squared distances multiplied by the kernel parameter `gamma`. This gives us a matrix of shape `(m, n)` where each entry is the Gaussian kernel value between a test sample and a training sample.\n3. We compute the decision function values for each test sample by taking the dot product of the kernel matrix with the Lagrange multipliers `alpha` and the training labels `y_train`, and adding the bias term `b`. This gives us a vector of shape `(m,)` where each entry is the decision function value for a test sample.\n4. We predict the labels by taking the sign of the decision function values using `np.sign(decisions)`. This gives us a vector of shape `(m,)` where each entry is either 1 or -1.\n5.

We get the labels of the k nearest neighbours by indexing into `y_data` with the neighbour indices.\n6. We count the occurrences of each label using `Counter`.\n7. We get the label with the highest count by finding the maximum value in the counter.\n8. If there's a tie, we return the lexicographically smallest label by taking the minimum of the tied labels.\n9. We append the predicted label to the result list.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input lists are not empty and that the number of neighbours `k` is not larger than the number of training samples. If these assumptions are not met, the code may raise an error or produce incorrect results."}

We first validate the input by checking if the lengths of the two lists are equal and if all values are non-negative. If either condition fails, we return -1.\n2. We compute the logarithmic differences between the predicted and actual values, adding 1 to each value to avoid taking the logarithm of zero.\n3. We compute the mean of the squared logarithmic differences using NumPy's `mean` function.\n4. We take the square root of the mean to get the RMSLE value.\n5.

If `derivative` is `True`, we compute the derivative of tanh using the formula `1 - tanh(x) ** 2`.

We first check if the input `x` is a NumPy array and convert it to a Python list if it is.\n2. We handle the corner case where `N = 0` by returning an empty list.\n3. We initialize the `autocorrelation` list with zeros, with a length equal to the length of the input `x`.\n4. We use a nested loop to compute the autocorrelation coefficients. The outer loop iterates over the lags `k`, and the inner loop iterates over the indices `n` of the input `x`.

We calculate the base probability `base` by dividing `epsilon` by the number of actions.\n4. We calculate the probability of the greedy action `p_greedy` by subtracting `epsilon` from 1 and adding `base`.\n5.

Next, we calculate the denominator of the step size formula by summing the squares of the new learner's predictions `h_pred`.\n4. If the denominator is zero, we return 1.0 by convention, as this indicates that the new learner perfectly fits the residuals.\n5. Otherwise, we calculate the optimal step size `gamma` by dividing the numerator by the denominator.\n6.

We get all labels with the highest vote count using a list comprehension.\n6. If there's a tie, we choose the smallest label using `min(max_labels)`.\n7.

We first validate that `sigma` is strictly positive by checking if it's less than or equal to 0. If it is, we return -1 immediately.\n2. We convert the input `x` to a NumPy array using `np.asarray(x)`. This allows us to perform efficient computations on the input data.\n3. We compute the PDF for every value in `x` using the formula `f(x; \u03bc, \u03c3) = 1\u2044(\u221a(2\u03c0) \u03c3) \u00b7 exp(\u2212(x\u2212\u03bc)\u00b2 \u2044 (2\u03c3\u00b2))`. We use NumPy's vectorized operations to compute the PDF for all values in `x` simultaneously.\n4. We round each result to 5 decimal places using a list comprehension.\n5. Finally, we return the list of rounded PDF values.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n```python\n# Test with a list of values\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nmean = 3\nsigma = 1\nprint(gaussian_pdf(x, mean, sigma))  # Output: [0.398167, 0.398167, 0.398167, 0.398167, 0.398167]\n\n# Test with a NumPy array\nx = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nmean = 3\nsigma = 1\nprint(gaussian_pdf(x, mean, sigma))  # Output: [0.398167, 0.398167, 0.398167, 0.398167, 0.398167]\n\n# Test with an empty input\nx = []\nmean = 3\nsigma = 1\nprint(gaussian_pdf(x, mean, sigma))  # Output: []\n\n# Test with invalid sigma\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nmean = 3\nsigma = 0\nprint(gaussian_pdf(x, mean, sigma))  # Output: -1\n```"}

We then compute the new second moment estimate `v_t` by multiplying the previous moment `v_prev` by `beta2` and adding the product of `(1 - beta2)` and the squared gradient `grad**2`.\n3. We compute the bias-corrected first and second moment estimates `m_hat_t` and `v_hat_t` by dividing `m_t` and `v_t` by `(1 - beta1**t)` and `(1 - beta2**t)`, respectively.\n4. We compute the updated parameters `theta_new` by subtracting the product of the learning rate `alpha` and the bias-corrected first moment estimate `m_hat_t` divided by the square root of the bias-corrected second moment estimate `v_hat_t` plus the small constant `epsilon`.\n5. Finally, we increment the time step `t` by 1 and return the updated parameters, the new first and second moment estimates, and the incremented time step as a tuple.\n\nNote that we use the `np.round` function to round all floating-point values to 6 decimal places before returning them as Python lists."}

We first check if the input sequence is empty or if `samples` is not positive. If either condition is true, we return an empty list immediately.\n2. We use the `cycle` function from the `itertools` module to create an infinite iterator that cycles over the input sequence.\n3. We use the `islice` function from the `itertools` module to get the first `samples` items from the infinite iterator created in step 2.

We first convert the input lists to numpy arrays for efficient computation.\n2. We initialize an empty list to store the predictions.\n3. We iterate over each test sample in `X_test`.\n4. For each test sample, we calculate the Euclidean distance between the test sample and all training samples using `np.linalg.norm`.\n5. We get the indices of the k nearest neighbours using `np.argsort`.\n6. We get the labels/targets of the k nearest neighbours.\n7. If the problem is 'classify', we use majority vote to get the most common label. If there's a tie, we get the smallest label.\n8. If the problem is 'regress', we calculate the mean of the target values and round it to 4 decimal places.\n9. We append the prediction to the predictions list.\n10.

The `build_tree` method recursively builds the decision tree by finding the best feature and threshold, splitting the node, and recursively building the left and right subtrees. The `predict` method makes predictions on a given input `x` by traversing the tree.\n\nThe `decision_tree_predict` function initializes the root node and builds the decision tree using the `build_tree` method. It then makes predictions on the test set using the `predict` method.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input data is already preprocessed and normalized. If the data is not normalized, you may need to add additional preprocessing steps."}

The `metrics` dictionary maps metric names to their corresponding functions.\n4. The `d` function is the returned callable that computes the distance between two vectors. It first checks if the input validation passes, and if not, returns -1. Otherwise, it calls the corresponding distance function from the `metrics` dictionary.\n5. The `metric` function returns the `d` function.\n\nYou can test the `metric` function with the example call:\n```python\nmetric('euclidean')([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])  # returns 5.1962\n```"}

We first convert the input `data` to a NumPy array using `np.array(data)`. This allows us to use NumPy's vectorized operations.\n2. We use `np.isnan(arr)` to get a boolean mask for NaN values in the array. This mask will be `True` for NaN values and `False` otherwise.\n3. We use `np.isin(arr, [None])` to get a boolean mask for None values in the array. This mask will be `True` for None values and `False` otherwise.\n4. We combine the two masks using the bitwise OR operator (`np.logical_or`). This will give us a new mask that is `True` for both NaN and None values.\n5. We use `np.count_nonzero(missing_mask)` to count the number of `True` values in the mask. This will give us the total number of missing values.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n```python\nprint(num_missing([1, 2, None, 4, np.nan, 6]))  # Output: 2\nprint(num_missing([1, 2, 'nan', 4, 6]))  # Output: 0\nprint(num_missing([]))  # Output: 0\n```"}

We use a `set` called `seen_ids` to keep track of the ids we've seen so far. This allows us to check if an id has been seen before in constant time.\n2. We iterate over the `registry` list, checking each item to see if it's a dictionary with an \"id\" key.\n3. If an item is a dictionary with an \"id\" key, we get the id value and check if it's in the `seen_ids` set. If it's not, we add it to the set and append it to the `unique_ids` list.\n4. Finally, we return the `unique_ids` list, which contains the unique ids in the order they first appeared in the `registry` list.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nregistry = [\n    {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"env1\"},\n    {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"env2\"},\n    {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"env3\"},  # duplicate id\n    {\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"env4\"},\n    {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"env5\"},  # duplicate id\n]\n\nunique_ids = get_gym_environs(registry)\nprint(unique_ids)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n```"}

We first validate the input types and dimensions. We check if both inputs are lists, tuples, or NumPy arrays. If not, we raise a `TypeError`. We also check if the lengths of the two sequences are equal. If not, we return -1.\n2.  We convert the input sequences to NumPy arrays for efficient operations. If one of the inputs is a single-element list or tuple, we also convert it to a NumPy array.\n3.  We compute the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two sequences using `np.abs(actual - predicted)`.\n4.  We calculate the average of the absolute differences using `np.mean(differences)`.\n5.

We first unpack the input parameters into separate variables for clarity.\n2. We compute the output height and width using the formula provided in the task.\n3. We check if the output dimensions are positive integers by verifying that they are greater than 0 and that they are equal to their integer values (i.e., they are not fractional).\n4.

If the `categories` argument is not provided, we infer it from the `labels` by converting the list to a set (to remove duplicates), sorting it, and converting it back to a list.\n2. We initialize the one-hot encoded matrix with zeros using `np.zeros`.\n3. We iterate over the `labels` and their indices using `enumerate`.\n4. For each label, we check if it's not in the `categories`. If it's not, we return `-1`.\n5. We get the index of the label in the `categories` using `categories.index`.\n6. We set the corresponding value in the encoded matrix to 1 using `encoded_matrix[i, category_index] = 1`.\n7.

We initialize a queue with the starting node `\"input\"` and an empty path.\n2. We keep track of visited nodes using a set `visited`.\n3. We loop until the queue is empty.\n4. In each iteration, we dequeue a node and its path.\n5. If we've reached the output node `\"output_realtime\"`, we return the path.\n6. We mark the node as visited.\n7. We add all unvisited neighbors of the node to the queue, along with their paths.\n8. If the queue is empty and no path is found, we return an empty list.\n\nNote that this implementation uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path. This is because we want to find the lexicographically smallest path, and BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\nExample use case:\n```python\ngraph = {\n    \"input\": [\"layer1\", \"layer2\"],\n    \"layer1\": [\"layer3\", \"layer4\"],\n    \"layer2\": [\"layer5\"],\n    \"layer3\": [\"output_realtime\"],\n    \"layer4\": [\"layer5\"],\n    \"layer5\": [\"output_realtime\"]\n}\n\nprint(extract_realtime_model(graph))  # Output: [\"input\", \"layer1\", \"layer3\", \"output_realtime\"]\n```"}

We set the random seed to 42 using `np.random.seed(42)` to ensure reproducibility.\n2. We compute `fan_in` and `fan_out` based on the shape of the tensor using the rules specified in the problem statement.\n3. We check if `fan_in` is zero, which would only happen for an empty shape containing a zero. If so, we return an empty list.\n4.

We compute the sigmoid for `z >= 0` using the formula `1 / (1 + exp(-z))`. We use `np.exp` to compute the exponential of `-z`.\n3. We compute the sigmoid for `z < 0` using the formula `exp(z) / (1 + exp(z))`. We use `np.exp` to compute the exponential of `z`.\n4. We combine the two cases using `np.where`, which returns an array with the same shape as the input, where the values are taken from the first argument if the condition is true, and from the second argument otherwise.\n5. We round the result to 4 decimal places using `np.round`.\n6. If the input was a NumPy array, we convert the result back to a Python list using `tolist()`. Otherwise, we return the result as a single float value using `item()`.\n\nYou can test the implementation using the following code:\n```python\nprint(sigmoid(1.0))  # Output: 0.5000\nprint(sigmoid(-1.0))  # Output: 0.2689\nprint(sigmoid([1.0, -1.0]))  # Output: [0.5, 0.2689]\nprint(sigmoid(np.array([1.0, -1.0])))  # Output: [0.5, 0.2689]\n```"}

We first check if the input `z` is a `numpy.ndarray`. If it is, we use `np.where` to apply the Leaky ReLU activation element-wise. We convert the result to a Python list using `tolist()`.\n2. If `z` is a list, we recursively apply the Leaky ReLU activation to each element. We use a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `z`. If an element is a list or a `numpy.ndarray`, we recursively call `leaky_relu` on it. If an element is a scalar (int or float), we apply the Leaky ReLU activation directly. If an element is neither a list nor a scalar, we leave it unchanged.\n3. If `z` is a scalar (int or float), we apply the Leaky ReLU activation directly.\n\nNote that we use the `isinstance` function to check the type of `z` and `i` in the list comprehension. This ensures that we handle lists, `numpy.ndarray`s, and scalars correctly."}

We first check if the `formula` parameter is valid. If it's not one of the two supported strings, we raise an `AssertionError`.\n2. We then use the chosen formula to convert the `hz` values to mel. We use NumPy's `log10` and `log` functions to compute the logarithms.\n3. We round the mel values to 4 decimal places using `np.round`.\n4. We convert the resulting NumPy array to a list using the `tolist` method.\n5.

We first check if the input array `labels` is 1-D. If it's not, we raise a `ValueError`.\n2. If `n_classes` is `None`, we set it to the maximum label value + 1. This ensures that every class present in the data gets a dedicated column.\n3. We create a 2-D NumPy array `one_hot` with shape `(N, C)` filled with zeros. We use `dtype=float` to ensure that the 1s are represented as 1.0.\n4. We use NumPy's advanced indexing to set the column index corresponding to the label value to 1.0. We use `np.arange(labels.shape[0])` to create an array of indices for the rows, and `labels` to create an array of indices for the columns.\n5.

We create a generator that yields the indices of each mini-batch. We use a `for` loop to iterate over the range of mini-batches, and for each mini-batch, we calculate the start and end indices using `i * batchsize` and `min((i + 1) * batchsize, N)`, respectively.

We define a dictionary `card_values` to map card labels to their nominal values.\n2. We initialize the total score and the number of Aces to 0.\n3. We iterate over the cards in the hand, getting the nominal value of each card.\n4. If the card is an Ace, we increment the number of Aces and add its value to the total score.\n5.

We set the random seed to 42 using `random.seed(42)`. This ensures that the sampling is deterministic, meaning that the same sequence of random numbers will be generated every time the function is called.\n2. We check if the `batch_size` exceeds the length of the `memory` list using `if batch_size > len(memory)`. If it does, we return -1 as per the task requirements.\n3. If the `batch_size` is within the bounds of the `memory` list, we use `random.sample` to select `batch_size` unique transitions from the `memory` list. The `random.sample` function returns a list of the selected items in the order they are produced.\n\nExample use case:\n```python\nmemory = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nbatch_size = 5\nprint(sample_replay_memory(memory, batch_size))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\nNote that the output will be different every time you run the code, but the sequence of numbers will be the same due to the deterministic random sampling."}

The `zip_longest` function is used to iterate over the floats and wrap widths in parallel, and the `fillvalue` argument is used to specify the value to use when one of the iterables is exhausted. The `math.floor` function is not needed in this implementation, as the `//` operator is used for integer division."}

We compute the standard deviation `s` using the formula `sqrt(2 / (fan_in + fan_out))`.\n3. We use `np.random.normal` to generate a NumPy array with the desired shape, mean 0, and standard deviation `s`. We use the `astype` method to ensure the array has a float32 dtype.\n4.

After iterating over all edges, we remove duplicates from each inner list by converting it to a set (which automatically removes duplicates) and then converting it back to a list. We also sort the list to ensure that the order of neighbours is the same as their appearance order in `V`.\n6. Finally, we return the adjacency list `G`.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nV = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nE = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (1, 3)]\nprint(build_adj_list(V, E))  # Output: [[2, 3, 4], [1, 3, 4], [1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 3]]\n```"}

We iterate over all features and all unique values for each feature.\n2. For each feature and value, we create a prediction vector `predictions` where each element is the predicted label for the corresponding sample.\n3. We calculate the weighted error by summing the absolute difference between the predictions and the true labels, weighted by the sample weights.\n4. If the current error is lower than the best error found so far, we update the best stump and its error.\n5. Finally, we return the best stump.\n\nNote that we use `np.unique` to get the unique values for each feature, and `np.abs` to calculate the absolute difference between the predictions and the true labels. We also use `round` to round the threshold and weighted error to 4 decimal places."}

This is because NumPy provides a more efficient and convenient way to perform element-wise operations on arrays.\n2. We use NumPy's `clip` function to clip the values in the array to the interval `[-5, 5]`. The `clip` function takes three arguments: the input array, the minimum value to clip to, and the maximum value to clip to. In this case, we pass `values`, `-5`, and `5` as arguments.\n3. The `clip` function returns a new array with the clipped values. We assign this result to the `clipped_values` variable.\n4.

We start by checking if the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it contains a 'value' key). If it is, we return the value.\n2. If it's not a leaf node, we get the feature index and threshold from the current node.\n3. We compare the sample value at the current feature index with the threshold. If the sample value is less than or equal to the threshold, we go to the true branch. Otherwise, we go to the false branch.\n4. We repeat steps 1-3 until we reach a leaf node, at which point we return the value.\n\nExample use case:\n\n```python\ntree = {\n    'feature_i': 0,\n    'threshold': 5,\n    'true_branch': {\n        'feature_i': 1,\n        'threshold': 3,\n        'true_branch': {'value': 1},\n        'false_branch': {'value': 0}\n    },\n    'false_branch': {\n        'feature_i': 2,\n        'threshold': 2,\n        'true_branch': {'value': 2},\n        'false_branch': {'value': 3}\n    }\n}\n\nsample = [4, 2, 1]\n\nprint(evaluate_decision_tree(tree, sample))  # Output: 1\n```\n\nIn this example, the decision tree has three features, and the sample has values [4, 2, 1]. The function traverses the tree based on the feature values and thresholds, and returns the value stored in the reached leaf node, which is 1."}

We first check if the inputs `y_true` and `y_pred` are of equal length. If not, we raise a `ValueError`.\n2. We calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) using the formula `np.mean((y_true - y_pred) ** 2)`.\n3. We calculate the gradient of the MSE with respect to the predictions using the formula `2/N * (y_pred \u2212 y_true)`, where `N` is the number of samples. We use a list comprehension to create a list of gradients.\n4. We calculate the accuracy by comparing the rounded predictions with the true labels using `np.mean(np.round(y_pred) == y_true)`.\n5. We round all values to 4 decimal places using the `round()` function.\n6. We return a tuple containing the MSE, gradient, and accuracy.\n\nNote that we use NumPy functions (`np.mean()`, `np.round()`) to perform the calculations, but we also use list comprehensions to create the gradient list.

We first check if `alpha` is non-negative. If it's not, we raise a `ValueError`.\n2. If `return_grad` is `True`, we return the gradient of the regularization term, which is simply `alpha * w`. We use NumPy's broadcasting rules to ensure that the result has the same shape as `w`.\n3. If `return_grad` is `False`, we return the regularization value, which is `0.5 * alpha * sum(w^2)`. We use NumPy's `sum` function to compute the sum of the squares of the elements in `w`, and then multiply the result by `0.5 * alpha`.\n\nNote that we use NumPy's broadcasting rules to ensure that the result has the correct shape, regardless of the shape of `w`. This means that if `w` is a 1-D array, the result will be a scalar value. If `w` is a 2-D array, the result will be a 2-D array with the same shape as `w`.\n\nYou can test the function using the example you provided:\n```python\nw     = np.array([1.0, -2.0, 3.0])\nalpha = 0.1\n\nprint(l2_regularization(w, alpha))            # \u279c 0.7\nprint(l2_regularization(w, alpha, True))      # \u279c array([ 0.1, -0.2,  0.3])\n```"}

It checks that `alpha` is non-negative and raises a `ValueError` if it's not.\n* The `__call__` method computes the L1 penalty value by taking the absolute value of each element in the input array `w`, summing them up, and multiplying the result by `alpha`. It returns the result as a Python float.\n* The `grad` method computes the gradient of the L1 penalty with respect to `w` by taking the sign of each element in `w` (i.e., -1 for negative elements, 1 for positive elements, and 0 for zero elements) and multiplying the result by `alpha`. It returns the result as a NumPy array with the same shape as `w`.\n\nYou can use the `L1Regularization` class as follows:\n```python\nreg = L1Regularization(0.5)\nw = np.array([1, 2, 3])\nprint(reg(w))  # Output: 6.0\nprint(reg.grad(w))  # Output: [0.5 0.5 0.5]\n```\nNote that if `alpha` is 0, the penalty and gradient will both be zero."}

We first check if the inputs are scalars using the `isinstance` function. If they are, we return the squared difference between them.\n2. If the inputs are iterables, we check if they have identical length using the `len` function. If they don't, we return -1.\n3. We then check if the iterables are not empty using the `len` function.

If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the sequence, we simply return the sorted sequence according to the chosen order.\n3. We initialize the heap with the first `k` elements from the sequence using `heapq.heapify`.\n4. We iterate over the rest of the sequence. For each number, we check if it's larger/smaller than the smallest/largest number in the heap. If so, we replace the smallest/largest number in the heap with the current number using `heapq.heappop` and `heapq.heappush`.\n5. Finally, we return the heap as a sorted list using `sorted`.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the memory footprint never exceeds O(k) and each push/pop operation costs O(log k) due to the use of a binary heap."}

We define a `Node` class with a `val` attribute for the numeric value and a `key` attribute for the key associated with that value. We also define comparison operators (`__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`) to compare the values of two nodes.\n2.  The `inorder_keys` function takes a list of `(key, value)` pairs as input and returns a list of keys in in-order traversal order.\n3.  We first check if the input list is empty. If it is, we return an empty list.\n4.  We create the root node with the first pair's value and key.\n5.  We then iterate over the remaining pairs and insert each node into the BST using the `_insert` function.\n6.  The `_insert` function recursively inserts a node into the BST. If the node's value is less than the current node's value, it goes left; otherwise, it goes right.\n7.  After inserting all nodes, we perform an in-order traversal of the BST using a recursive function `inorder_traversal`. This function visits nodes in strictly non-decreasing order of their stored values.\n8.  Finally, we return the list of keys obtained from the in-order traversal.\n\nYou can test the code with the following example:\n\n```python\npairs = [(1, 5), (2, 3), (3, 7), (4, 2), (5, 9)]\nprint(inorder_keys(pairs))  # Output: [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]\n```"}

We first calculate the linear term by taking the dot product of the feature matrix `X` and the linear weight vector `w`.\n2. We then calculate the bias term by simply using the scalar bias `w0`.\n3. Next, we calculate the interaction term by taking the dot product of the feature matrix `X` and the transpose of the factor matrix `v`, squaring the result, and then subtracting the dot product of the squared feature matrix `X` and the squared transpose of the factor matrix `v`. We sum over the columns of the result using `np.sum` with `axis=1`.\n4. We then add the bias term, linear term, and interaction term together to get the FM prediction.\n5. We round the predictions to four decimal places using `np.round`.\n6. Finally, we convert the predictions to a list of floats using `tolist()` and return the result.\n\nNote that we assume that the input shapes are consistent, as specified in the problem statement.

We first validate that the two inputs have the same non-zero length. If this condition is violated, we return -1.\n2. We convert the inputs to NumPy arrays for efficient numerical operations.\n3. We compute the differences between the actual and predicted values.\n4. We compute the squared differences.\n5. We compute the mean of the squared differences.\n6. We compute the square root of the mean squared difference, which gives us the RMSE.\n7. We round the resulting value to 4 decimal places.\n\nYou can test this function with the following example:\n```python\nactual = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]\npredicted = [1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1]\nprint(root_mean_squared_error(actual, predicted))  # Output: 0.1000\n```\nNote that this function assumes that the inputs are numeric sequences.

We first check if the input `arr` is a list. If it is, we convert it to a NumPy array with a float data type using `np.array(arr, dtype=float)`. This is because NumPy arrays are more efficient for vectorized operations, and we need to ensure that the array has a float data type to perform the clipping operation.\n2. We use the `np.clip` function to replace all negative values in the array with 0.0. The `np.clip` function takes three arguments: the input array, the minimum value to clip to (in this case, 0.0), and the maximum value to clip to (in this case, infinity). The `np.inf` constant represents infinity.\n3. Finally, we convert the clipped array back to a list using the `tolist` method and return it.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n```python\nprint(clip_non_negative([-1, -2, 3, -4]))  # Output: [0.0, 0.0, 3.0, 0.0]\nprint(clip_non_negative([[-1, 2], [-3, 4]]))  # Output: [[0.0, 2.0], [0.0, 4.0]]\nprint(clip_non_negative(np.array([-1, -2, 3, -4])))  # Output: [0.0, 0.0, 3.0, 0.0]\n```"}

We flatten the `summary_dict` by merging the nested \"parameters\" and \"hyperparameters\" sub-dictionaries into the top level using the `update()` method. We also update the `flattened_summary` dictionary with the top-level key-value pairs from `summary_dict`.\n3. We iterate over the key-value pairs in the `flattened_summary` dictionary.

Walk from the root and update/extend the path by increasing the support of every visited node by 1.\n\nThe final FP-Tree is represented as a nested dictionary where every node stores two keys: \"support\" and \"children\".

We first count the frequency of each token in the input list using a dictionary `frequency`.\n2.  We create a min-heap of nodes, where each node represents a token and its frequency. We use a tuple `(freq, node)` as the heap element, where `freq` is the frequency of the node and `node` is the node itself.\n3.  We repeatedly pop the two nodes with the smallest frequencies from the heap, merge them into a new parent node, and push the parent back into the heap. This process continues until only one node remains in the heap.\n4.  We traverse the tree from the root node to every leaf node to obtain the code words. We use a recursive function `traverse` to perform the traversal, where we append '0' to the code when traversing the left child and '1' when traversing the right child.\n5.  Finally, we return a dictionary `codes` that maps every unique token to its Huffman code.\n\nYou can test the function with a sample input list of tokens, such as `['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'banana']`. The function should return a dictionary that maps each token to its Huffman code, such as `{'apple': '10', 'banana': '110', 'orange': '111'}`."}

We first create the design matrix `X_design` by raising each element of `X` to the power of `i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `degree`. We use `np.power` to compute the powers and `np.array` to create a 2D array. We then transpose the array using `.T` to get the correct shape.\n2. We add a column of ones to the design matrix using `np.hstack` to account for the bias term.\n3. We create the regularisation matrix `reg_matrix` by adding the regularisation factor to the diagonal of the identity matrix using `np.eye` and `np.multiply`.\n4. We compute the closed-form solution for the weight vector `w` using the formula `w = (X\u1d40\u00b7X + \u03bbI)\u207b\u00b9 \u00b7 X\u1d40\u00b7y`. We use `np.linalg.inv` to compute the inverse of the matrix `X_design.T @ X_design + reg_matrix` and then multiply it by `X_design.T @ y`.\n5. We round the coefficients to 4 decimal places using `np.round` and convert the result to a list using `tolist`.\n\nYou can test the function with the following example:\n```python\nX = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\ndegree = 2\nreg_factor = 0.1\n\ncoefficients = polynomial_ridge_regression(X, y, degree, reg_factor)\nprint(coefficients)\n```\nThis should output the learned coefficients rounded to 4 decimal places."}

We first import the `numpy` library and define the `cross_entropy` function with the required parameters.\n2. We define the tiny positive constant `eps` to avoid numerical issues with `log(0)`.\n3. We compute the cross-entropy loss using the formula `L = \u2212\u2211_{i=1..n} \u2211_{j=1..m} y_{ij} \u00b7 log( \u0177_{ij} + eps )`.

For each `n`, we compute the cosine term using the DCT-II formula and add it to `c_k`.\n5. If `orthonormal` is `True`, we apply the orthonormal scaling to `c_k` based on the value of `k`.\n6. We append the rounded value of `c_k` to the `coefficients` list.\n7.

We start with a running prediction filled with zeros, having the same shape as a single update array.\n2. We iterate over each update `u` in the list of updates, and for each one, we subtract the scaled update from the running prediction.\n3. After all updates, we check if we're doing regression or classification. If it's regression, we simply return the running prediction, rounded to 4 decimals. If it's classification, we apply the soft-max function row-wise to the running prediction, subtract the maximum value along each row to avoid numerical instability, and then return the vector of predicted class indices using `np.argmax`.\n\nNote that I used the `np.exp` function to compute the soft-max, and `np.max` with `keepdims=True` to avoid broadcasting issues. I also used `np.argmax` to get the indices of the maximum values along the last axis (i.e., the class labels)."}

We define the recommended constants `alpha` and `scale`.\n4. We handle the three cases for `order`:\n\t* `order == 0`: We compute the SELU activation using the formula `scale * ELU(x, alpha)`. We use `np.where` to apply the ELU function element-wise.\n\t* `order == 1`: We compute the first derivative of SELU using the formula `scale * (1 if x > 0 else alpha * exp(x))`.\n\t* `order == 2`: We compute the second derivative of SELU using the formula `scale * (0 if x > 0 else alpha * exp(x))`.\n5. We round the result to 4 decimal places using the `round` method and convert it to a list using the `tolist` method.\n6. If `order` is not 0, 1, or 2, we raise a `ValueError`.\n\nYou can test the function with the following examples:\n```python\nprint(selu(1.0))  # SELU(1.0)\nprint(selu(1.0, order=1))  # d(SELU)/dx(1.0)\nprint(selu(1.0, order=2))  # d\u00b2(SELU)/dx\u00b2(1.0)\nprint(selu(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])))  # SELU([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\nprint(selu(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), order=1))  # d(SELU)/dx([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\nprint(selu(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), order=2))  # d\u00b2(SELU)/dx\u00b2([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n```"}

We first ensure that the input `x` is a NumPy array using `np.asarray(x)`.\n2. We then flatten the input if it has more than one dimension using `x.flatten()`.\n3. We apply the pre-emphasis filter using the recurrence relation `filtered_x = x[1:] - alpha * x[:-1]`. We use NumPy's slicing to extract the first and second halves of the signal, and then subtract the delayed version of the signal from the current version.\n4.

We first check if `Eg` is `None`, and if so, we initialise it with zeros of the same shape as `grad`.\n2. We calculate the new running average of the squared gradients using the formula `Eg = rho * Eg + (1 - rho) * grad ** 2`.\n3. We add a small constant `1e-8` to `Eg` to prevent division by zero.\n4.

If `window_len` is 1, we return a list containing a single element, 1.0, for both symmetric and periodic cases.\n3. If `symmetric` is `True`, we generate a symmetric window by creating an array `n` of length `window_len` with values from 0 to `window_len-1`. We then compute the Hann window coefficients using the formula `0.5 - 0.5 * cos(2 * pi * n / (window_len - 1))` and round the result to 4 decimal places using `np.round`. We convert the resulting NumPy array to a Python list using `tolist()`.\n4. If `symmetric` is `False`, we generate a periodic window by creating an array `n` of length `window_len + 1` with values from 0 to `window_len`.

It also assumes that the number of nearest neighbours `k` is between 1 and the number of training samples `n_train`."}

We first check if the `norm` parameter is either \"l1\" or \"l2\". If it's neither, we return -1 for both the penalty and the gradient.\n2. We initialize the `penalty` variable to 0 and the `gradient` list to an empty list.\n3. If `norm` is \"l1\", we iterate over the `weights` list and for each weight `w`, we add its absolute value to the `penalty` and append `C * np.sign(w)` to the `gradient` list. `np.sign(w)` returns -1 if `w` is negative, 1 if `w` is positive, and 0 if `w` is 0.\n4. If `norm` is \"l2\", we iterate over the `weights` list and for each weight `w`, we add 0.5 * `w`\u00b2 to the `penalty` and append `C * w` to the `gradient` list.\n5. We round the `penalty` and each element of the `gradient` list to 4 decimal places using the `round` function.\n6. Finally, we return the `penalty` and the `gradient` list as a tuple.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n```python\nprint(regularization([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], C=0.01, norm=\"l1\"))  # (0.0300, [0.0100, 0.0200, 0.0300])\nprint(regularization([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], C=0.01, norm=\"l2\"))  # (0.0550, [0.0100, 0.0200, 0.0300])\nprint(regularization([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], C=0.01, norm=\"invalid\"))  # (-1, [-1, -1, -1])\n```"}

It learns the model parameters (weights and bias) from the training set `(X_train, y_train)` by minimizing the binary cross-entropy loss using gradient descent.\n2. It uses the learned parameters to predict the class labels for `X_test`.\n3. It returns the predictions as a Python list of `int`s (0 or 1) in the same order as the rows of `X_test`.\n\nNote that I've used the `@` operator for matrix multiplication, which is a more concise and readable way to perform matrix multiplication in NumPy. I've also used the `np.hstack` function to add the bias term to the design matrices, and the `np.newaxis` syntax to ensure that `y_train` is a column vector."}

The `linear_kernel` function takes any number of keyword arguments (`**kwargs`), but ignores them.\n2. The function returns an inner function `f(x1, x2)`.\n3. Inside `f`, we convert the inputs `x1` and `x2` to `np.ndarray` objects of `float` type using `np.array`.\n4. We check if the two vectors have the same length using `len(x1) != len(x2)`. If they don't, we immediately return `-1`.\n5. If the vectors have the same length, we compute their dot product using `np.inner` and return the result as a Python `float`.\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n```python\nkernel = linear_kernel()\nprint(kernel([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]))  # Output: 32\nprint(kernel([1, 2, 3], [4, 5]))  # Output: -1\n```"}

We use `os.path.realpath` to resolve any symbolic links in the input path and get the absolute path.\n2. We use `os.path.split` to split the absolute path into a pair (head, tail), where `head` is the directory part and `tail` is the file name.\n3. If the `tail` is empty, it means the path ended with a separator, so we return the `head` (which is the parent directory).\n4. Otherwise, we return the `head` (which is the directory containing the file).\n\nNote that we don't need to manually remove any \"..\" or \".\" segments, as `os.path.realpath` and `os.path.split` will handle these cases correctly.\n\nExample use cases:\n```python\nprint(get_scriptdir(\"/path/to/file.txt\"))  # Output: /path/to\nprint(get_scriptdir(\"./file.txt\"))  # Output:.\nprint(get_scriptdir(\"/path/to/./file.txt\"))  # Output: /path/to\nprint(get_scriptdir(\"/path/to/../file.txt\"))  # Output: /path\nprint(get_scriptdir(\"/path/to/file.txt/\"))  # Output: /path/to\n```"}

This is done using the following line: `one_hot[np.arange(labels.size), labels] = 1`. This uses NumPy's advanced indexing to set the correct elements to 1.\n5. Finally, we convert the NumPy array `one_hot` back to a list of lists using the `tolist()` method, and return it.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nlabels = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]\nprint(to_categorical(labels))  # Output: [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]\n\nlabels = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]\nprint(to_categorical(labels, num_classes=3))  # Output: [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]\n```"}

We then convert the inputs to NumPy arrays using the `np.array()` function if they are not already NumPy arrays. This is because NumPy arrays provide more efficient and convenient operations for numerical computations.\n3. We check if the inputs contain no elements by checking the length of the NumPy arrays. If they are empty, we return -1.\n4. We compute the squared differences between the two inputs using the `**` operator, which raises each element of the arrays to the power of 2.\n5.

The first step is to count the frequency of each item in the transactions and filter out items that do not reach the minimum support. We also calculate the minimum support count, which is the minimum number of occurrences an item-set must have to be considered frequent.\n2. We build the FP-tree by iterating over each transaction and adding each item to the tree. We use a dictionary to store the tree, where each key is an item and the value is a list of prefixes that lead to that item.\n3. The recursive mining process starts with the header table, which is a dictionary that maps each item to a list of prefixes that lead to that item. We iterate over each item in the header table and recursively mine the conditional tree.\n4. If the conditional tree consists of a single path, we enumerate all non-empty combinations of the items on that path and add them to the result.\n5. If the conditional tree consists of multiple paths, we recursively mine each path and add the results to the final list of frequent item-sets.\n6.

We calculate the pair-wise interaction term by taking the dot product of `X` and `V`, squaring the result, and then subtracting the dot product of `X` squared and `V` squared. We sum this term along the rows (axis=1) to get the interaction term for each sample.\n4. We calculate the bias term by multiplying the global bias `w0` with an array of ones with the same shape as the number of samples.\n5. We combine the linear, interaction, and bias terms to get the final predictions.\n6. We round the predictions to 4 decimal places using `np.round`.\n7. Finally, we convert the numpy array back to a list and return it.\n\nYou can test this function with sample inputs to verify its correctness."}

We first check if the `current_phase` is valid by checking if it's either \"training\" or \"testing\". If not, we return -1.\n2. We then check if both `set_train` and `set_test` are supplied. If so, we return -1, as this is not allowed.\n3. We check if the values of `set_train` and `set_test` are valid boolean values. If not, we return -1.\n4.

We iterate over the key-value pairs in the dictionary `d`.\n3. For each key-value pair, we build the new key by concatenating the prefix with the current key using a dot (`.`) if the prefix is not empty.\n4. If the value `v` is a dictionary, we recursively call `_flatten` with the sub-dictionary and the new key as the prefix.\n5. If the value `v` is not a dictionary, we simply add it to the result dictionary with the new key.\n6.

We first mean-centre the data by subtracting the mean of each feature and target value.\n2. We then compute the dot product of the transposed design matrix `X` with itself (`X_T_X`) and the dot product of the transposed design matrix with the target vector (`X_T_y`).\n3. If the regularisation strength `lambda_` is zero, we use the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse to avoid numerical instability when inverting the matrix.\n4. Otherwise, we add the regularisation term to the diagonal of `X_T_X` and solve for the optimal weights using the `np.linalg.solve` function.\n5. We recover the bias by subtracting the product of the mean of the design matrix and the weights from the mean of the target vector.\n6. Finally, we round the weights and bias to 4 decimal places using a list comprehension and the `round` function.\n\nNote that we use the `np.linalg.pinv` function to compute the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse when `lambda_` is zero, and the `np.linalg.solve` function to solve for the optimal weights when `lambda_` is non-zero."}

For each point, we find all points within the epsilon neighborhood using a simple Euclidean distance check.\n4. We check if the point is a core point by checking if the number of neighbors is greater than or equal to `min_samples`. If it is, we mark the point as a core point and initialize a queue with the point.\n5. We perform a breadth-first search (BFS) from the core point by popping points from the queue and adding their unlabeled neighbors to the current cluster.

If the error count is zero, we break out of the loop early, indicating convergence.\n8. Finally, we round the weights and bias to the nearest 4th decimal place and return them along with the error count history.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input data `X_train` and labels `y_train` are NumPy arrays.

We first check if a seed is provided, and if so, we set the random seed using `random.seed(seed)`. This ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers for a given seed.\n2. We initialize four empty lists: `X_train`, `X_val`, `y_train`, and `y_val`. These will store the generated data.\n3. We loop over the range of classes `m`. For each class `c`, we calculate the base value `base` using the formula `10 * (c // 2)`.\n4. We generate `n_train` and `n_val` random points for each class using `np.random.uniform`. We use the `size` argument to specify the shape of the output arrays.\n5. We extend the `y_train` and `y_val` lists with the class label `c` repeated `n_train` and `n_val` times, respectively.\n6. We round the coordinates of the generated points to 4 decimal places using `np.round`.\n7. We append the generated points to the `X_train` and `X_val` lists.\n8. After looping over all classes, we concatenate the points in `X_train` and `X_val` using `np.concatenate`.\n9. We convert the `y_train` and `y_val` lists to NumPy arrays using `np.array`.\n10. Finally, we return the generated data as a tuple of four NumPy arrays.\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n```python\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = generate_data(m=5, n_train=10, n_val=5, seed=42)\nprint(X_train.shape, X_val.shape, y_train.shape, y_val.shape)\n```\nThis should output:\n```\n(50, 2) (25, 2) (50,) (25,)\n```"}

Finally, it converts the resulting array back to a list using the `tolist()` method and returns it.\n\nYou can test this function with a sample input, like this:\n\n```python\nstate = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\ninitial_state = make_initial_state(state)\nprint(initial_state)\n```\n\nThis should output the stacked state as a 3-D list, where the frame is repeated four times along the last axis."}

We first check if `a` is equal to `b` using the `==` operator. If they are equal, we return 0.\n2. If `a` is not equal to `b`, we check if `a` is greater than `b` using the `>` operator. If it is, we return 1.\n3. If `a` is neither equal to nor greater than `b`, it must be less than `b`, so we return -1.\n\nThis implementation meets the output constraints, as it returns only one of the three possible integers: -1, 0, or 1.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n```python\nprint(cmp(5, 3))  # Output: 1\nprint(cmp(3, 5))  # Output: -1\nprint(cmp(5, 5))  # Output: 0\nprint(cmp(\"hello\", \"world\"))  # Output: -1\nprint(cmp(\"world\", \"hello\"))  # Output: 1\nprint(cmp(\"hello\", \"hello\"))  # Output: 0\n```"}

We first initialize an empty dictionary `graph` to store the adjacency list for each open cell.\n2. We iterate over each cell in the maze using two nested loops.\n3. For each open cell, we initialize its adjacency list to an empty list.\n4. We then check all four directions (up, down, left, right) by iterating over the possible changes in row and column (`dr` and `dc`).\n5. For each direction, we calculate the adjacent cell's coordinates (`nr` and `nc`) by adding the direction changes to the current cell's coordinates.\n6. We check if the adjacent cell is within the maze boundaries and is open (i.e., its value is 0).\n7. If the adjacent cell is open, we add it to the adjacency list of the current cell.\n8. After iterating over all cells, we sort the adjacency lists to ensure that the output is deterministic.\n9. Finally, we return the `graph` dictionary.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nmaze = [\n    [0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\ngraph = maze_to_graph(maze)\nprint(graph)\n```\nOutput:\n```python\n{(0, 0): [(1, 0), (0, 1)],\n (0, 1): [(0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 1)],\n (0, 2): [(0, 1)],\n (1, 0): [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0)],\n (1, 1): [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)],\n (1, 2): [(1, 1)],\n (2, 0): [(1, 0)],\n (2, 1): [(1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 2)],\n (2, 2): [(2, 1)]}\n```"}

We initialize the centroids with the first `k` samples in `X`.\n2. We repeat the clustering process for at most `max_iters` iterations.\n3. In each iteration, we assign every sample to the nearest centroid using the squared Euclidean distance.\n4. We update each centroid to the arithmetic mean of the samples currently assigned to it.\n5. We check for early stopping if all centroids move less than `1e-4` in a full iteration.\n6. If a cluster becomes empty during an update, we keep its centroid unchanged.\n7. After convergence, we sort the centroids in ascending lexicographical order and round every coordinate to 4 decimal places.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input `X` is a 2-D NumPy array with shape `(n_samples, n_features)`. The output is a Python list of lists, where each inner list is a centroid rounded to 4 decimals."}
