We first calculate the minimum support threshold by multiplying the minimum support fraction with the total number of transactions and rounding up to the nearest integer using `math.ceil`.\n2. We initialize an empty dictionary `itemsets_support` to store the support count for each itemset.\n3. We generate all possible itemsets of size `r` from the first transaction using `combinations`. We iterate over all possible sizes `r` from 1 to the length of the first transaction.\n4. For each itemset, we convert it to a tuple and sort it to ensure that the same itemset is always represented in the same order.\n5. We count the support for the current itemset by summing up the number of transactions that contain all items in the itemset. We use a generator expression to iterate over the transactions and count the number of items in each transaction that are also in the itemset.\n6. If the support is greater than or equal to the threshold, we add the itemset and its support count to the `itemsets_support` dictionary.\n7. Finally, we return the `itemsets_support` dictionary.\n\nYou can test the function with the example input you provided:\n```python\ntransactions = [\n    ['bread', 'milk'],\n    ['bread', 'diaper', 'beer', 'egg'],\n    ['milk', 'diaper', 'beer', 'coke'],\n    ['bread', 'milk', 'diaper', 'beer'],\n    ['bread', 'milk', 'diaper', 'coke']\n]\nminsup = 0.6\n\nprint(find_frequent_itemsets(transactions, minsup))\n```\nThis should output:\n```python\n{('bread',): 4, ('milk',): 4, ('diaper',): 4, ('beer',): 3, ('bread', 'milk'): 3, ('bread', 'diaper'): 3, ('diaper', 'milk'): 3, ('beer', 'diaper'): 3}\n```"}

We check for convergence by calculating the maximum change of any centre between two consecutive iterations. If the maximum change is smaller than `epsilon`, we stop the algorithm.\n5.

This gives us a matrix of shape `(m, n)` where each entry is the squared distance between a test sample and a training sample.\n2. We then compute the Gaussian kernel matrix by exponentiating the negative of the squared distances multiplied by the kernel parameter `gamma`. This gives us a matrix of shape `(m, n)` where each entry is the Gaussian kernel value between a test sample and a training sample.\n3. We compute the decision function values for each test sample by taking the dot product of the kernel matrix with the Lagrange multipliers `alpha` and the training labels `y_train`, and adding the bias term `b`. This gives us a vector of shape `(m,)` where each entry is the decision function value for a test sample.\n4. We predict the labels by taking the sign of the decision function values using `np.sign(decisions)`. This gives us a vector of shape `(m,)` where each entry is either 1 or -1.\n5. Finally, we convert the predicted labels to a list of integers using `predicted_labels.tolist()`.\n\nNote that we use NumPy's vectorized operations to compute the decision function values and predicted labels, which makes the implementation efficient and scalable."}

The agent moves to the neighboring cells that are not burning and not visited, and the fire spreads to the neighboring cells that are not burning. If the agent reaches the goal, the time is returned; otherwise, -1 is returned."}

The `_euclidean`, `_manhattan`, `_chebyshev`, and `_cosine` functions implement the corresponding distance metrics.\n3. The `metrics` dictionary maps metric names to their corresponding functions.\n4. The `d` function is the returned callable that computes the distance between two vectors. It first checks if the input validation passes, and if not, returns -1. Otherwise, it calls the corresponding distance function from the `metrics` dictionary.\n5. The `metric` function returns the `d` function.\n\nYou can test the `metric` function with the example call:\n```python\nmetric('euclidean')([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])  # returns 5.1962\n```"}

The `squared_log_error` function takes two inputs, `actual` and `predicted`, and returns a NumPy array containing the element-wise squared logarithmic errors.\n2. The `mean_squared_log_error` function performs input validation:\n\t* Checks if both inputs are lists, tuples, or NumPy arrays.\n\t* Checks if the lengths of the two inputs are equal.\n\t* Checks if all values in both inputs are non-negative.\n\t* If any of these checks fail, returns -1.\n3.

The function calculates the mean squared log error using `np.mean`.\n6. The function rounds the result to 4 decimal places using `round`.\n7. The function returns the result.\n\nYou can test this implementation using the example you provided:\n```python\nactual = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\npredicted = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5]\nprint(mean_squared_log_error(actual, predicted))\n```\nThis should output the MSLE rounded to 4 decimal places."}

We compute the sigmoid for `z >= 0` using the formula `1 / (1 + exp(-z))`. We use `np.exp` to compute the exponential of `-z`.\n3. We compute the sigmoid for `z < 0` using the formula `exp(z) / (1 + exp(z))`. We use `np.exp` to compute the exponential of `z`.\n4. We combine the two cases using `np.where`, which returns an array with the same shape as the input, where the values are taken from the first argument if the condition is true, and from the second argument otherwise.\n5. We round the result to 4 decimal places using `np.round`.\n6. If the input was a NumPy array, we convert the result back to a Python list using `tolist()`. Otherwise, we return the result as a single float value using `item()`.\n\nYou can test the implementation using the following code:\n```python\nprint(sigmoid(1.0))  # Output: 0.5000\nprint(sigmoid(-1.0))  # Output: 0.2689\nprint(sigmoid([1.0, -1.0]))  # Output: [0.5, 0.2689]\nprint(sigmoid(np.array([1.0, -1.0])))  # Output: [0.5, 0.2689]\n```"}

We first check if the input shape has exactly two dimensions. If it does, we can directly use the two dimensions as `fan_in` and `fan_out`. Otherwise, we compute `fan_in` and `fan_out` by multiplying the second dimension with the product of all dimensions after the first two.\n2. We compute the standard deviation `s` using the formula `sqrt(2 / (fan_in + fan_out))`.\n3. We use `np.random.normal` to generate a NumPy array with the desired shape, mean 0, and standard deviation `s`. We use the `astype` method to ensure the array has a float32 dtype.\n4.

It then uses the `get()` method of the dictionary to retrieve the value associated with the key `name`. If the key is not found, it returns `None`.\n3. It checks if the retrieved value is callable using the `callable()` function. If it's not callable, it raises a `ValueError`.\n4. If the value is callable, it returns the value, which is the initializer function.\n\nYou can test the solution with the following code:\n\n```python\nname = \"ones_init\"\nshape = (2, 2)\ninit_fn = get_initializer(name)\noutput = init_fn(shape)\nprint(output)  # Output: [[1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0]]\n```\n\nThis code retrieves the `ones_init` function using the `get_initializer` function and then calls it with the shape `(2, 2)` to get a matrix of ones."}

We first validate that the two parent matrices have the same shape by checking their lengths and the lengths of their rows. If they don't match, we return -1.\n2. We convert the parent matrices to NumPy arrays for efficient slicing.\n3. We perform the single-point column crossover by concatenating the corresponding parts of the two parent arrays along the columns (axis=1). We use NumPy's `concatenate` function to do this efficiently.\n4. We convert the resulting NumPy arrays back to ordinary Python lists using the `tolist` method.\n5.

We initialize an empty dictionary `adj` to store the adjacency list of the graph.\n2. We iterate over the adjacency lists in `G['_G']`. Each adjacency list corresponds to a vertex in the graph.\n3. For each vertex, we get its label `v` from `G['_V2I']`.\n4. We initialize an empty list `adj[v]` to store the neighbours of `v`.\n5. We iterate over the edges in the adjacency list. Each edge is a tuple `(source_label, target_label, weight)`.\n6. If the graph is directed, we simply append the edge to `adj[v]`.\n7. If the graph is undirected, we append the edge to both `adj[v]` and `adj[u]`.\n8. We sort the neighbour list `adj[v]` alphabetically by the neighbour label.\n9. Finally, we return the adjacency dictionary `adj`.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input graph is not empty and that the adjacency lists in `G['_G']` are not empty.

We first convert the input `x` to a NumPy array using `np.asarray(x)`. This ensures that the input can be processed as a NumPy array, regardless of its original type (e.g., list, tuple, or another NumPy array).\n2. We then use the `np.isin` function to check if all elements of `x` are either 0 or 1. The `np.isin` function returns a boolean array where each element is `True` if the corresponding element in `x` is in the array `[0, 1]`, and `False` otherwise.\n3. Finally, we use the `np.all` function to check if all elements of the boolean array returned by `np.isin` are `True`. If all elements are `True`, then all elements of `x` are either 0 or 1, and we return `True`.

We extract the prior parameters `V_inv` from `V`, which can be a scalar, a 1-D sequence, or a full 2-D array.\n4. We compute the posterior parameters `X_T_X`, `X_T_y`, `V_inv_X_T_X`, `Sigma_b`, and `mu_b` using the closed-form formulas.\n5. We round the coefficients `mu_b` to 4 decimal places using `np.round`.\n6. We return the rounded coefficients as a list of floats.\n\nNote that we use `np.hstack` to add the intercept column to `X`, and `np.linalg.inv` to compute the inverse of `V_inv_X_T_X`.

Compute the support for every item by counting the occurrences of each item in the transactions.\n2.  Discard the items whose support is smaller than `min_support` to get the frequent items.\n3.  Create a global ordering of the remaining items by sorting them in decreasing order of support and then alphabetically.\n4.

The `[:, np.newaxis]` part adds a new axis to `row_sums` so that it can be broadcasted to match the shape of `data`.\n5.

We define the recommended constants `alpha` and `scale`.\n4. We handle the three cases for `order`:\n\t* `order == 0`: We compute the SELU activation using the formula `scale * ELU(x, alpha)`. We use `np.where` to apply the ELU function element-wise.\n\t* `order == 1`: We compute the first derivative of SELU using the formula `scale * (1 if x > 0 else alpha * exp(x))`.\n\t* `order == 2`: We compute the second derivative of SELU using the formula `scale * (0 if x > 0 else alpha * exp(x))`.\n5. We round the result to 4 decimal places using the `round` method and convert it to a list using the `tolist` method.\n6. If `order` is not 0, 1, or 2, we raise a `ValueError`.\n\nYou can test the function with the following examples:\n```python\nprint(selu(1.0))  # SELU(1.0)\nprint(selu(1.0, order=1))  # d(SELU)/dx(1.0)\nprint(selu(1.0, order=2))  # d\u00b2(SELU)/dx\u00b2(1.0)\nprint(selu(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])))  # SELU([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\nprint(selu(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), order=1))  # d(SELU)/dx([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\nprint(selu(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), order=2))  # d\u00b2(SELU)/dx\u00b2([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n```"}

If `symmetric` is `True`, we generate a symmetric window by creating an array `n` of length `window_len` with values from 0 to `window_len-1`.

We convert the resulting NumPy array to a Python list using `tolist()`.\n4. If `symmetric` is `False`, we generate a periodic window by creating an array `n` of length `window_len + 1` with values from 0 to `window_len`.

The `axis=0` argument tells NumPy to average along the first axis (i.e., the estimators axis).\n2. We then use a list comprehension to round every averaged probability to four decimal places. We use `map` to apply the `round` function to each element in the inner lists.\n3. Finally, we return both the averaged probability matrix and the final predicted class label (index of the maximal probability) for every sample. We use another list comprehension to find the index of the maximal probability for each sample.\n\nNote that we use NumPy arrays to perform the averaging and rounding operations, but we convert the result back to regular Python lists before returning it. This is because the problem statement requires us to return regular Python lists."}

If a point is already labeled, it skips it. Otherwise, it finds all reachable points within eps and checks if the point is a core point (i.e., it has at least min_samples neighbors). If it is, it labels the point and its neighbors with the current cluster id and increments the cluster id.\n\nThe `get_reachable_points` function calculates the Euclidean distance between the given point and all other points and returns the indices of points within eps distance.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input data is a 2D NumPy array where each row is a sample and columns are features.

The first step is to count the frequency of each item in the transactions and filter out items that do not reach the minimum support. We also calculate the minimum support count, which is the minimum number of occurrences an item-set must have to be considered frequent.\n2. We build the FP-tree by iterating over each transaction and adding each item to the tree. We use a dictionary to store the tree, where each key is an item and the value is a list of prefixes that lead to that item.\n3. The recursive mining process starts with the header table, which is a dictionary that maps each item to a list of prefixes that lead to that item. We iterate over each item in the header table and recursively mine the conditional tree.\n4. If the conditional tree consists of a single path, we enumerate all non-empty combinations of the items on that path and add them to the result.\n5. If the conditional tree consists of multiple paths, we recursively mine each path and add the results to the final list of frequent item-sets.\n6. Finally, we sort the frequent item-sets by length and lexicographically, and return the result.\n\nYou can test the function with the example transactions and minimum support value:\n```python\ntransactions = [\n    [\"A\", \"B\", \"D\", \"E\"],\n    [\"B\", \"C\", \"E\"],\n    [\"A\", \"B\", \"D\", \"E\"],\n    [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"E\"],\n    [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"],\n    [\"B\", \"C\", \"D\"]\n]\n\nmin_sup = 3\n\nresult = fp_growth(transactions, min_sup)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis should output the expected result:\n```python\n[('A',), ('B',), ('C',), ('D',), ('E',), ('A', 'B'), ('A', 'D'), ('A', 'E'),\n ('B', 'C'), ('B', 'D'), ('B', 'E'), ('C', 'E'), ('D', 'E'),\n ('A', 'B', 'D'), ('A', 'B', 'E'), ('A', 'D', 'E'), ('B', 'C', 'E'), ('B', 'D', 'E'),\n ('A', 'B', 'D', 'E')]\n```"}

Then it initializes the result matrix with ones for the degree-0 term. It iterates over the degrees from 1 to the given degree, and for each degree, it generates all combinations of feature indices with that degree. For each combination, it calculates the product of the corresponding features and appends it to the result matrix. Finally, it returns the result matrix, truncating the last column if the degree is less than the number of samples.\n\nNote that this solution uses list comprehensions and the `combinations_with_replacement` function from the `itertools` module to generate the combinations of feature indices. It also uses the `enumerate` function to iterate over the indices and values of the input list `X`."}

We apply the affine activation function by multiplying the input `x` by the slope and adding the intercept. This is done using the expression `slope * x + intercept`.\n3. The first derivative of the affine activation function is simply the slope, which we compute using `slope * np.ones_like(x)`. This creates an array of ones with the same shape as `x`, which we then multiply by the slope.\n4. The second derivative of the affine activation function is 0, which we compute using `np.zeros_like(x)`.\n5. We round the results to 4 decimal places using `np.round()`.\n6.

We check if the point is a core point by checking if the number of neighbors is greater than or equal to `min_samples`.

We perform a breadth-first search (BFS) from the core point by popping points from the queue and adding their unlabeled neighbors to the current cluster. We also add the core point to the queue if it is not already there.\n6. We repeat step 5 until the queue is empty.\n7. After all core points are visited, every still-unlabeled point is noise and receives the label -1.\n\nNote that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the pairwise distance calculations, where n is the number of samples.

We first check if a seed is provided, and if so, we set the random seed using `random.seed(seed)`. This ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers for a given seed.\n2. We initialize four empty lists: `X_train`, `X_val`, `y_train`, and `y_val`. These will store the generated data.\n3. We loop over the range of classes `m`. For each class `c`, we calculate the base value `base` using the formula `10 * (c // 2)`.\n4. We generate `n_train` and `n_val` random points for each class using `np.random.uniform`. We use the `size` argument to specify the shape of the output arrays.\n5. We extend the `y_train` and `y_val` lists with the class label `c` repeated `n_train` and `n_val` times, respectively.\n6. We round the coordinates of the generated points to 4 decimal places using `np.round`.\n7. We append the generated points to the `X_train` and `X_val` lists.\n8. After looping over all classes, we concatenate the points in `X_train` and `X_val` using `np.concatenate`.\n9. We convert the `y_train` and `y_val` lists to NumPy arrays using `np.array`.\n10. Finally, we return the generated data as a tuple of four NumPy arrays.\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n```python\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = generate_data(m=5, n_train=10, n_val=5, seed=42)\nprint(X_train.shape, X_val.shape, y_train.shape, y_val.shape)\n```\nThis should output:\n```\n(50, 2) (25, 2) (50,) (25,)\n```"}

We first initialize the centres as the first `k` points in the dataset `X`.\n2. We then perform the assignment step by computing the Euclidean distance from each point to each centre, and assigning each point to the nearest centre (in case of a tie, we choose the centre with the smaller index).\n3. In the update step, we recompute each centre as the mean of all points assigned to it. If a centre loses all its points, we keep it unchanged.\n4. We repeat steps 2-3 until the assignments stop changing or the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n5. Finally, we round the coordinates of the centres to 4 decimals and return the final labels and centres.\n\nYou can test this implementation with a sample dataset, for example:\n```python\nX = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0], [9.0, 10.0]])\nk = 2\nmax_iters = 10\n\nlabels, centres = kmeans(X, k, max_iters)\nprint(labels)\nprint(centres)\n```\nThis should output the final labels and centres of the clusters."}
