{"task_id": 1, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to write a Python function that computes the dot product of a matrix and a vector. The function should check if the dimensions are compatible (i.e., the number of columns in the matrix must equal the length of the vector). If they are not compatible, the function should return -1. Otherwise, it should compute the resulting vector where each element is the dot product of a row of the matrix with the vector.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Dimensions**: First, we need to verify that the number of columns in the matrix (each row's length) matches the length of the vector. If not, return -1.\n2. **Compute Dot Products**: For each row in the matrix, compute the dot product with the vector. The dot product is the sum of the products of corresponding elements in the row and the vector.\n3. **Return Result**: Collect all these dot products into a list and return it. If the dimensions are incompatible, return -1.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef matrix_dot_vector(a: list[list[int|float]], b: list[int|float]) -> list[int|float] | int:\n    if not a or not b:\n        return -1  # Handle empty matrix or vector cases as per problem's unstated assumptions\n    \n    num_columns = len(a[0])\n    if num_columns != len(b):\n        return -1\n    \n    result = []\n    for row in a:\n        if len(row) != num_columns:\n            return -1  # In case rows have inconsistent lengths\n        dot_product = sum(row[i] * b[i] for i in range(num_columns))\n        result.append(dot_product)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Check for Empty Inputs**: The function first checks if either the matrix `a` or the vector `b` is empty. Although the problem description does not explicitly handle this, it's a good practice to return -1 in such cases.\n2. **Dimension Compatibility Check**: The function checks if the number of columns in the matrix (taken as the length of the first row) matches the length of the vector. If not, it returns -1 immediately.\n3. **Row Consistency Check**: For each subsequent row in the matrix, the function checks if the row length matches the number of columns in the first row. This ensures all rows are of uniform length, which is necessary for a valid matrix.\n4. **Dot Product Calculation**: For each row in the matrix, the function calculates the dot product with the vector by multiplying each corresponding element and summing the products. This result is collected into a list.\n5. **Return Result**: The list of dot products is returned if all checks pass. If any check fails (dimension mismatch or inconsistent row lengths), the function returns -1.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the matrix-vector dot product while ensuring all edge cases, such as dimension mismatches, are properly addressed."}
{"task_id": 2, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to write a Python function that computes the transpose of a given matrix. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by flipping the matrix over its main diagonal, which means that the row and column indices of the matrix are swapped. For example, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix will be at position (j, i) in the transposed matrix.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Structure of the Matrix**: The given matrix is a 2-dimensional list where each sublist represents a row. The transpose of the matrix will have rows converted to columns and vice versa. \n2. **Check for Edge Cases**: If the matrix is empty, the transpose should also be an empty matrix. Similarly, if the matrix has only one row or one column, the transpose will convert rows to columns or columns to rows, respectively.\n3. **Construct the Transposed Matrix**: For a matrix with dimensions m x n (m rows and n columns), the transposed matrix will have dimensions n x m. The element at position (i, j) in the original matrix becomes the element at position (j, i) in the transposed matrix. This can be achieved by iterating over each column index first and then each row index, collecting elements column-wise from the original matrix to form rows in the transposed matrix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef transpose_matrix(a: list[list[int|float]]) -> list[list[int|float]]:\n    if not a:\n        return []\n    # Determine the number of rows and columns in the original matrix\n    rows = len(a)\n    cols = len(a[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    # Create the transposed matrix by swapping rows and columns\n    transposed = []\n    for j in range(cols):\n        new_row = []\n        for i in range(rows):\n            new_row.append(a[i][j])\n        transposed.append(new_row)\n    return transposed\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Edge Handling**: The function first checks if the input matrix `a` is empty. If it is, the function returns an empty list immediately.\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The number of rows in the original matrix is determined by `len(a)`, and the number of columns is determined by `len(a[0])` assuming the matrix is non-empty. This gives the dimensions of the original matrix (rows x columns).\n3. **Building the Transposed Matrix**: The transposed matrix is constructed by iterating over each column index `j` from 0 to columns-1. For each column `j`, a new row is created by collecting elements from each row `i` (from 0 to rows-1) of the original matrix at column `j`. This new row is then added to the transposed matrix.\n4. **Result**: The resulting transposed matrix has dimensions (columns x rows), where each row in the transposed matrix corresponds to a column from the original matrix.\n\nThis approach efficiently swaps the rows and columns of the original matrix to produce its transpose, handling all edge cases such as empty matrices or matrices with varying row lengths (though the problem assumes the input is a valid matrix with consistent row lengths)."}

The function should return the reshaped matrix as a nested list if the reshaping is possible; otherwise, it should return an empty list.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Reshape Feasibility**: The reshaping operation is feasible only if the total number of elements in the original matrix matches the total number of elements in the new shape. For example, reshaping a 2x3 matrix (6 elements) into a 3x2 matrix (6 elements) is feasible, but reshaping it into a 4x2 matrix (8 elements) is not.\n2. **Convert to NumPy Array**: Convert the input nested list into a NumPy array to leverage NumPy's reshaping capabilities.\n3. **Attempt Reshaping**: Use NumPy's `reshape` method to reshape the array into the desired dimensions. If the reshaping is not possible (due to incompatible dimensions), NumPy will raise a `ValueError`, which we will catch to return an empty list.\n4. **Convert Back to List**: If reshaping is successful, convert the NumPy array back to a nested list using the `tolist()` method and return it. If not, return an empty list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef reshape_matrix(a: list[list[int|float]], new_shape: tuple[int, int]) -> list[list[int|float]]:\n    try:\n        np_array = np.array(a)\n        reshaped = np.reshape(np_array, new_shape)\n        return reshaped.tolist()\n    except ValueError:\n        return []\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Feasibility Check**: The function first converts the input matrix into a NumPy array. The reshaping operation is attempted inside a try-except block to handle cases where the new shape is incompatible with the original matrix's total elements.\n2. **Reshaping Attempt**: The `np.reshape` method is used to reshape the array into the dimensions specified by `new_shape`. If the total elements in the original matrix do not match the product of the dimensions in `new_shape`, a `ValueError` is raised.\n3. **Handling Errors**: The except block catches the `ValueError` and returns an empty list, indicating that reshaping is not possible.\n4. **Conversion to List**: If reshaping is successful, the reshaped NumPy array is converted back to a nested list using the `tolist()` method and returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for reshape feasibility and handles errors gracefully, ensuring the function meets the specified requirements."}
{"task_id": 4, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to write a Python function that calculates the mean of a matrix either by row or by column based on the specified mode. The function should return a list of means where each element corresponds to the mean of a row or a column in the original matrix.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Matrix Structure**: The matrix is given as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row. For example, a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns would be [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]].\n2. **Row-wise Mean Calculation**: When the mode is 'row', we need to compute the mean of each row in the matrix. This involves iterating over each row, summing the elements of the row, and dividing by the number of elements in the row.\n3. **Column-wise Mean Calculation**: When the mode is 'column', we need to compute the mean of each column. This is slightly more complex because columns are spread across different rows. We can transpose the matrix (convert columns into rows) and then compute the mean of each transposed row, which corresponds to the original column. Alternatively, we can iterate over each column index, collect all elements from each row at that index, sum them, and divide by the number of rows.\n4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider cases where the matrix might be empty or contain rows of varying lengths (though typically, matrices are assumed to be rectangular).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef calculate_matrix_mean(matrix: list[list[float]], mode: str) -> list[float]:\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n    \n    if mode == 'row':\n        return [sum(row) / len(row) for row in matrix]\n    elif mode == 'column':\n        # Determine the number of columns by the length of the first row\n        num_columns = len(matrix[0]) if matrix else 0\n        means = []\n        for col in range(num_columns):\n            column_sum = 0.0\n            column_count = 0\n            for row in matrix:\n                if col < len(row):  # handle cases where rows might have different lengths\n                    column_sum += row[col]\n                    column_count += 1\n            if column_count == 0:\n                means.append(0.0)\n            else:\n                means.append(column_sum / column_count)\n        return means\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Mode must be either 'row' or 'column'\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Row-wise Calculation**: For each row in the matrix, the function calculates the mean by summing all elements in the row and dividing by the number of elements in that row. This is straightforward using a list comprehension.\n2. **Column-wise Calculation**: The function first checks the number of columns (assuming all rows have the same number of columns as the first row). For each column index, it iterates through each row, summing the elements at that column index. The sum is then divided by the number of rows to get the mean for that column. This approach handles potential irregular row lengths by only summing elements that exist.\n3. **Edge Handling**: If the matrix is empty, the function returns an empty list. If the mode is neither 'row' nor 'column', it raises a ValueError.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles both row and column mean calculations while ensuring robustness against edge cases."}

Scalar multiplication involves multiplying every element of the matrix by a given scalar value. The result should be a new matrix where each element is the product of the corresponding element in the original matrix and the scalar.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Iterate through each element of the matrix**: The matrix is a 2-dimensional list (a list of lists), so we need to loop through each row and then each element within the row.\n2. **Multiply each element by the scalar**: For each element in the matrix, multiply it by the scalar value.\n3. **Construct the resulting matrix**: Store the results of these multiplications in a new matrix, maintaining the same structure as the original matrix (i.e., same number of rows and columns).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef scalar_multiply(matrix: list[list[int|float]], scalar: int|float) -> list[list[int|float]]:\n    return [[element * scalar for element in row] for row in matrix]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **List Comprehension**: The solution uses nested list comprehensions to efficiently process each element in the matrix.

For example, if there are `n` features each with `m` observations, the input will be a list of `n` lists, each of length `m`.\n2. **Calculate Means**: For each feature, compute the mean of its observations.\n3. **Compute Covariance**: For each pair of features (i, j), compute the covariance using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (X_{i,k} - \\bar{X_i})(X_{j,k} - \\bar{X_j})\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\bar{X_i} \\) and \\( \\bar{X_j} \\) are the means of the ith and jth features, respectively, and `n` is the number of observations.\n4. **Construct the Matrix**: The covariance matrix will be a symmetric matrix where the element at (i, j) is the covariance between the ith and jth features.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef calculate_covariance_matrix(vectors: list[list[float]]) -> list[list[float]]:\n    if not vectors:\n        return []\n    \n    num_features = len(vectors)\n    num_observations = len(vectors[0]) if num_features > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Check that all vectors have the same number of observations\n    for vec in vectors:\n        if len(vec) != num_observations:\n            raise ValueError(\"All vectors must have the same number of observations\")\n    \n    if num_observations == 0:\n        return []\n    \n    # Calculate the mean of each feature\n    means = [sum(feature) / num_observations for feature in vectors]\n    \n    # Initialize the covariance matrix\n    covariance_matrix = [[0.0 for _ in range(num_features)] for _ in range(num_features)]\n    \n    # Compute each element of the covariance matrix\n    for i in range(num_features):\n        for j in range(num_features):\n            covariance = 0.0\n            for k in range(num_observations):\n                covariance += (vectors[i][k] - means[i]) * (vectors[j][k] - means[j])\n            covariance /= (num_observations - 1)\n            covariance_matrix[i][j] = covariance\n    \n    return covariance_matrix\n```\n\n### Test Cases\nTo verify the correctness of the implementation, we can use the following test cases:\n\n1. **Test Case 1**: Simple case with two features and three observations.\n   ```python\n   vectors = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n   expected_output = [\n       [1.0, 1.0],\n       [1.0, 1.0]\n   ]\n   assert calculate_covariance_matrix(vectors) == expected_output\n   ```\n\n2. **Test Case 2**: Another simple case with two features where one feature is constant.\n   ```python\n   vectors = [[1, 1, 1], [2, 3, 4]]\n   expected_output = [\n       [0.0, 0.0],\n       [0.0, 1.0]\n   ]\n   assert calculate_covariance_matrix(vectors) == expected_output\n   ```\n\n3. **Test Case 3**: Three features with four observations.\n   ```python\n   vectors = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 1, 0, 1], [5, 5, 5, 5]]\n   expected_output = [\n       [1.6666666666666667, 0.3333333333333333, 0.0],\n       [0.3333333333333333, 0.3333333333333333, 0.0],\n       [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n   ]\n   computed = calculate_covariance_matrix(vectors)\n   # Using approximate comparison due to floating point precision\n   for i in range(len(expected_output)):\n       for j in range(len(expected_output[i])):\n           assert abs(computed[i][j] - expected_output[i][j]) < 1e-9\n   ```\n\n4. **Test Case 4**: Empty input should return an empty list.\n   ```python\n   assert calculate_covariance_matrix([]) == []\n   ```\n\n5. **Test Case 5**: Single feature with one observation (should raise an error or handle edge case, but division by zero in variance calculation would occur if not checked).\n   ```python\n   vectors = [[1]]\n   # Note: For a single observation, the sample covariance is undefined (division by zero)\n   # The function will return a matrix with NaN or handle it, but in this implementation, it would return [[0.0]] (but mathematically, it's undefined)\n   # Depending on requirements, might need to handle such cases differently.\n   computed = calculate_covariance_matrix(vectors)\n   print(computed)  # Outputs [[0.0]], but mathematically it's undefined.\n   ```\n\nThese test cases cover various scenarios including normal cases, edge cases, and error handling. The implementation correctly computes the covariance matrix for valid inputs and checks for consistent observation counts across features."}

These serve as the base cases for the recursion.\n2. **Recursive Expansion**: For larger matrices, the function initializes the determinant value to zero. It then iterates over each element in the first row:\n   - **Minor Matrix Construction**: For each element, it constructs the minor matrix by excluding the current row (the first row) and the current column. This involves iterating through the remaining rows and columns, collecting elements that are not in the current column.\n   - **Sign Calculation**: The sign for each element is determined by \\((-1)^{i+j}\\) where \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are the row and column indices (0 and col in this case, since we are expanding along the first row).\n   - **Recursive Determinant Calculation**: The determinant of the minor matrix is computed recursively, multiplied by the current element and its sign, and added to the running total determinant.\n3. **Return Result**: The accumulated determinant value is returned after processing all elements in the first row.\n\nThis approach efficiently breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems, leveraging recursion to handle the nested computations required for Laplace's Expansion.

Specifically, each column of \\( P \\) is the coordinate vector of the corresponding basis vector in \\( B \\) when expressed in basis \\( C \\).\n\n2. **Matrix Representation**: Let \\( B = [\\mathbf{b}_1, \\mathbf{b}_2, \\mathbf{b}_3] \\) and \\( C = [\\mathbf{c}_1, \\mathbf{c}_2, \\mathbf{c}_3] \\), where each \\( \\mathbf{b}_i \\) and \\( \\mathbf{c}_i \\) are column vectors. The transformation matrix \\( P \\) satisfies \\( B = C P \\), which implies \\( P = C^{-1} B \\). Here, \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) are matrices formed by the basis vectors as columns.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   - Convert the lists \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) into NumPy arrays, treating each basis vector as a column in the matrix.\n   - Compute the inverse of matrix \\( C \\).\n   - Multiply \\( C^{-1} \\) with \\( B \\) to get \\( P \\).\n   - Round the elements of \\( P \\) to 4 decimal places and convert the result back to a nested list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_basis(B: list[list[int]], C: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[float]]:\n    # Convert B and C to numpy arrays, each list is a column vector\n    B_matrix = np.array(B).T  # Each column is a basis vector of B\n    C_matrix = np.array(C).T  # Each column is a basis vector of C\n    \n    # Compute the inverse of C_matrix\n    C_inv = np.linalg.inv(C_matrix)\n    \n    # Calculate the transformation matrix P: P = C^{-1} B\n    P = np.dot(C_inv, B_matrix)\n    \n    # Round to 4 decimal places\n    P_rounded = np.round(P, decimals=4)\n    \n    # Convert to a list of lists (each inner list is a row)\n    return P_rounded.tolist()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Matrix Conversion**: The input lists \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) are converted into NumPy arrays. Each sublist in \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) represents a basis vector. The `.T` operation transposes these arrays so that each basis vector becomes a column in the matrix, which is the standard representation for basis matrices.\n2. **Inverse Calculation**: The inverse of matrix \\( C \\) (denoted \\( C^{-1} \\)) is computed using NumPy's `linalg.inv` function. This inverse is crucial because it allows us to transform vectors from the standard basis to the basis \\( C \\).\n3. **Matrix Multiplication**: The transformation matrix \\( P \\) is obtained by multiplying \\( C^{-1} \\) with \\( B \\). This product gives the matrix that transforms any vector from basis \\( B \\) to basis \\( C \\).\n4. **Rounding and Conversion**: The elements of \\( P \\) are rounded to four decimal places for readability and then converted back to a nested list format using the `tolist()` method, which matches the expected output structure.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the transformation matrix by leveraging linear algebra operations, ensuring accuracy and numerical stability through NumPy's optimized functions."}

For example, the exponent vector (2, 1) would translate to x1^2 * x2^1.\n5. **Construct the Resulting Matrix**: For each sample in the original dataset, compute all the polynomial terms and assemble them into a new row in the resulting matrix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement\n\ndef polynomial_features(X, degree):\n    if degree < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Degree must be at least 1\")\n    \n    n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n    features = []\n    \n    for d in range(1, degree + 1):\n        for comb in combinations_with_replacement(range(n_features), d):\n            exponents = np.zeros(n_features, dtype=int)\n            for idx in comb:\n                exponents[idx] += 1\n            if np.sum(exponents) <= degree:\n                features.append(exponents)\n    \n    # Remove duplicate exponent combinations (though combinations_with_replacement should avoid duplicates)\n    unique_features = []\n    seen = set()\n    for feat in features:\n        tuple_feat = tuple(feat)\n        if tuple_feat not in seen:\n            seen.add(tuple_feat)\n            unique_features.append(feat)\n    \n    # Sort the features for consistent order (e.g., (0,1) before (1,0), etc.)\n    unique_features.sort()\n    \n    # Compute the polynomial features for each sample\n    X_poly = np.ones((n_samples, len(unique_features)))\n    for i, exponents in enumerate(unique_features):\n        X_poly[:, i] = np.prod(np.power(X, exponents), axis=1)\n    \n    return X_poly.tolist()\n```\n\nWait, but the above approach might have some inefficiencies. For example, combinations_with_replacement generates combinations with replacement for each degree d, but for d>1, it may generate combinations where the sum of exponents is exactly d. However, when d is less than the degree, these combinations are still valid. So the code collects all combinations where the sum of exponents is between 1 and degree.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to generate all possible exponent vectors where each exponent is >=0 and the sum is between 1 and degree. This can be done using a recursive approach or using combinations_with_replacement in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible exponent tuples for each feature, then filter those where the sum is between 1 and degree.\n\nBut for the sake of time, let's proceed with the initial approach.\n\nHowever, the initial code may have some issues. For example, for degree 2 and two features, the exponents should include (1,0), (0,1), (2,0), (1,1), (0,2). The combinations_with_replacement when d=1 gives (0,) and (1,) (wait, no: for d=1, combinations_with_replacement(range(2),1) yields (0,) and (1,), which correspond to exponents [1,0] and [0,1]. For d=2, combinations_with_replacement(range(2),2) gives (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), which correspond to exponents [2,0], [1,1], and [0,2]. So the code would collect all these.\n\nSo the code should work for this case.\n\nBut let's test the function with a simple example.\n\nTest case:\n\nX = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n\ndegree = 2.\n\nExpected output for the first sample (1, 2) would be 1, 2, 1^2=1, 1*2=2, 2^2=4. So the first row should be [1, 2, 1, 2, 4]. The second row would be [3,4,9,12,16].\n\nSo the output should be [[1,2,1,2,4], [3,4,9,12,16]].\n\nBut according to the code, the unique_features would be:\n\nFor d=1: combinations are (0,) and (1,), leading to exponents [1,0] and [0,1].\n\nFor d=2: combinations are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), leading to exponents [2,0], [1,1], [0,2].\n\nSo the unique_features list would contain these five exponent vectors, sorted. So the order would be [0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [2,0], [0,2]. \n\nWait, the sorting of the unique_features is done via the list's sort method. When sorting a list of lists, Python sorts lexicographically. So [0,1] comes before [1,0], etc.\n\nSo the order would be [0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [2,0], [0,2].\n\nBut the corresponding terms for sample (a,b) would be:\n\n- [0,1]: a^0 * b^1 = b.\n\n- [1,0]: a^1 * b^0 = a.\n\n- [1,1]: a^1 * b^1 = a*b.\n\n- [2,0]: a^2 * b^0 = a^2.\n\n- [0,2]: a^0 * b^2 = b^2.\n\nSo the polynomial features for sample (1,2) would be [2, 1, 2, 1, 4], and for (3,4) would be [4,3,12,9,16].\n\nBut the expected output was [1,2,1,2,4] for the first sample. This indicates that the order of the features in the output is different. The expected output assumes that the original features come first, followed by higher-degree terms. So the code's current sorting might not match the expected order.\n\nTo match the expected order, perhaps the unique_features should be sorted in a way that lower-degree terms come first, and within the same degree, the order is lexicographical.\n\nSo for degree 2 and two features, the order should be:\n\n1. Degree 1 terms: [1,0], [0,1].\n\n2. Degree 2 terms: [2,0], [1,1], [0,2].\n\nSo the sorted unique_features should be [1,0], [0,1], [2,0], [1,1], [0,2].\n\nThus, the polynomial features for sample (a,b) would be a, b, a^2, a*b, b^2.\n\nSo the first sample (1,2) would be [1, 2, 1, 2, 4], which matches the expected output.\n\nTherefore, the code should sort the unique_features first by the sum of the exponents (degree), and then lexicographically.\n\nSo, modifying the sorting step:\n\nInstead of just unique_features.sort(), we need to sort first by the sum of the exponents, then by the exponents themselves.\n\nSo replace the sorting line with:\n\nunique_features.sort(key=lambda x: (sum(x), tuple(x)))\n\nThis will sort the features first by their degree (sum of exponents), then lexicographically.\n\nSo the updated code would be:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement\n\ndef polynomial_features(X, degree):\n    if degree < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Degree must be at least 1\")\n    \n    n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n    features = []\n    \n    for d in range(1, degree + 1):\n        for comb in combinations_with_replacement(range(n_features), d):\n            exponents = np.zeros(n_features, dtype=int)\n            for idx in comb:\n                exponents[idx] += 1\n            features.append(exponents)\n    \n    # Remove duplicate exponent combinations\n    unique_features = []\n    seen = set()\n    for feat in features:\n        tuple_feat = tuple(feat)\n        if tuple_feat not in seen:\n            seen.add(tuple_feat)\n            unique_features.append(feat)\n    \n    # Sort the features first by degree (sum of exponents), then lex order\n    unique_features.sort(key=lambda x: (sum(x), tuple(x)))\n    \n    # Compute the polynomial features for each sample\n    X_poly = np.ones((n_samples, len(unique_features)))\n    for i, exponents in enumerate(unique_features):\n        X_poly[:, i] = np.prod(np.power(X, exponents), axis=1)\n    \n    return X_poly.tolist()\n```\n\nThis should now produce the polynomial features in the desired order.\n\nLet's test this with the sample input:\n\nX = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n\ndegree = 2.\n\nThe unique_features would be:\n\n- [1,0] (sum 1)\n\n- [0,1] (sum 1)\n\n- [2,0] (sum 2)\n\n- [1,1] (sum 2)\n\n- [0,2] (sum 2)\n\nSo the order is correct.\n\nFor sample (1,2):\n\n- 1^1 * 2^0 = 1\n\n- 1^0 * 2^1 = 2\n\n- 1^2 * 2^0 = 1\n\n- 1^1 * 2^1 = 2\n\n- 1^0 * 2^2 = 4\n\nSo the first row is [1, 2, 1, 2, 4], which matches the expected output.\n\nSimilarly, the second row is [3,4,9,12,16].\n\nThus, the function works as expected.\n\n### Final Answer\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement\n\ndef polynomial_features(X, degree):\n    if degree < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Degree must be at least 1\")\n    \n    n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n    features = []\n    \n    for d in range(1, degree + 1):\n        for comb in combinations_with_replacement(range(n_features), d):\n            exponents = np.zeros(n_features, dtype=int)\n            for idx in comb:\n                exponents[idx] += 1\n            features.append(exponents)\n    \n    # Remove duplicate exponent combinations\n    unique_features = []\n    seen = set()\n    for feat in features:\n        tuple_feat = tuple(feat)\n        if tuple_feat not in seen:\n            seen.add(tuple_feat)\n            unique_features.append(feat)\n    \n    # Sort the features first by degree (sum of exponents), then lex order\n    unique_features.sort(key=lambda x: (sum(x), tuple(x)))\n    \n    # Compute the polynomial features for each sample\n    X_poly = np.ones((n_samples, len(unique_features)))\n    for i, exponents in enumerate(unique_features):\n        X_poly[:, i] = np.prod(np.power(X, exponents), axis=1)\n    \n    return X_poly.tolist()\n```"}

{"task_id": 34, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to create a function that performs one-hot encoding on a 1D numpy array of integer values. One-hot encoding converts each integer value into a binary vector where all elements are zero except the index corresponding to the integer, which is set to one. The function should handle an optional parameter `n_col` which specifies the number of columns in the resulting one-hot encoded array. If `n_col` is not provided, it should be determined from the maximum value in the input array plus one (assuming values start from 0).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Determine the Number of Columns**: If `n_col` is not provided, it should be set to the maximum value in the input array plus one. This is because the values in the array are treated as indices, and the one-hot encoding will have a column for each possible index from 0 to the maximum value.\n2. **Initialize the One-Hot Encoded Array**: Create a 2D numpy array of zeros with shape (length of input array, `n_col`). This array will hold the one-hot encoded values.\n3. **Set the Appropriate Indices to One**: For each element in the input array, set the corresponding column index in the one-hot array to 1. This can be efficiently done using numpy's advanced indexing.\n4. **Convert to List**: The result should be converted to a Python list using numpy's `tolist()` method before returning.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef to_categorical(x, n_col=None):\n    if n_col is None:\n        n_col = np.max(x) + 1\n    one_hot = np.zeros((x.shape[0], n_col), dtype=int)\n    one_hot[np.arange(x.shape[0]), x] = 1\n    return one_hot.tolist()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Determine `n_col`**: The function checks if `n_col` is provided. If not, it calculates `n_col` as the maximum value in the input array `x` plus one. This ensures that all values in `x` can be represented as indices in the one-hot encoded array.\n2. **Initialize Zero Array**: A 2D array of zeros is created with dimensions (number of elements in `x`, `n_col`). This array will later be populated with ones at the positions corresponding to the values in `x`.\n3. **Set Ones at Specific Indices**: Using numpy's advanced indexing, the function sets the value 1 at each row `i` and column `x[i]` for all elements in `x`. This effectively creates the one-hot encoding where each original value is represented by a 1 in the corresponding column of its row.\n4. **Convert to List**: The resulting numpy array is converted to a Python list using the `tolist()` method to meet the output constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the one-hot encoding process by leveraging numpy's capabilities for both initialization and indexing, ensuring optimal performance and correctness."}

For each threshold, the algorithm checks both directions (predict 1 if feature \u2265 threshold or predict -1 if feature < threshold) to find the one with the lowest weighted error.\n3. **Classifier Weight (Alpha)**: The weight of the classifier is computed using the formula `0.5 * log((1 - error)/error)`, which gives higher weights to classifiers with lower errors.\n4. **Updating Weights**: Misclassified samples have their weights increased by a factor of `exp(alpha)`, and all weights are normalized to sum to 1. This ensures subsequent classifiers focus more on previously misclassified samples.\n5. **Storing Classifiers**: Each classifier's parameters (feature index, threshold, direction, and alpha) are stored in a list after rounding to four decimal places for consistency.\n\nThis approach efficiently builds an AdaBoost classifier by iteratively focusing on the hardest samples, thus improving overall model accuracy."}

The formula ensures that the kernel fits within the padded input matrix as it slides over it with the specified stride.\n3. **Convolution Operation**: The kernel slides over the padded input matrix in steps determined by the stride. At each position, the corresponding section of the input matrix is multiplied element-wise with the kernel, and the results are summed to produce a single value in the output matrix.\n4. **Rounding and Conversion**: The resulting values in the output matrix are rounded to four decimal places for precision, and the numpy array is converted to a Python list to meet the output constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the convolution operation while respecting the constraints of padding and stride, providing an accurate and formatted result."}

{"task_id": 48, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To implement the Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) of a matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach that involves row operations to transform the matrix into its RREF. The key steps involve identifying pivot positions, ensuring the pivot is 1, and eliminating other entries in the pivot column. Here's how we can achieve this:\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given matrix and determine the number of rows and columns.\n2. **Pivot Tracking**: Initialize the pivot row and column to 0. This will help in tracking the current position being processed.\n3. **Row Operations**:\n   - **Find the Pivot**: For each column, find the first row (starting from the current pivot row) with a non-zero entry in that column. If no such row exists, move to the next column.\n   - **Swap Rows**: If the pivot element in the current pivot row is zero, swap it with a row below that has a non-zero entry in the current column.\n   - **Normalize the Pivot Row**: Divide the entire pivot row by the pivot element to make the pivot entry 1.\n   - **Eliminate Other Rows**: For all other rows, subtract multiples of the pivot row to make all other entries in the current column zero.\n4. **Update Pivot Position**: After processing a pivot, move the pivot position to the next row and column.\n5. **Handle Zero Rows**: Rows with all zeros will naturally end up at the bottom of the matrix after processing.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef rref(matrix):\n    mat = np.array(matrix, dtype=np.float64)\n    rows, cols = mat.shape\n    lead = 0\n    for r in range(rows):\n        if lead >= cols:\n            break\n        i = r\n        while mat[i, lead] == 0:\n            i += 1\n            if i == rows:\n                i = r\n                lead += 1\n                if cols == lead:\n                    return mat.tolist()\n        mat[[i, r]] = mat[[r, i]]\n        pivot = mat[r, lead]\n        if pivot != 0:\n            mat[r] = mat[r] / pivot\n        for i in range(rows):\n            if i != r and mat[i, lead] != 0:\n                mat[i] = mat[i] - mat[i, lead] * mat[r]\n        lead += 1\n    return mat.tolist()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The input matrix is converted into a NumPy array for easier manipulation. The dimensions of the matrix (rows and columns) are noted.\n2. **Pivot Tracking**: The variable `lead` keeps track of the current column being processed as a potential pivot column.\n3. **Finding the Pivot**: For each pivot position (starting from the first row and column), the algorithm searches for the first non-zero entry in the current column starting from the current row. If no non-zero entry is found, the column is skipped.\n4. **Row Swapping**: If the current row has a zero in the pivot position, it is swapped with a subsequent row that has a non-zero entry in the same column.\n5. **Normalization**: The pivot row is divided by the pivot element to set the pivot entry to 1.\n6. **Elimination**: For all other rows, the algorithm subtracts multiples of the pivot row to ensure all other entries in the pivot column are zero.\n7. **Pivot Update**: After processing a pivot column, the algorithm moves to the next column and row to continue the process until all rows or columns are exhausted.\n8. **Result Conversion**: The resulting matrix is converted back to a Python list using NumPy's `tolist()` method before returning.\n\nThis approach efficiently transforms the matrix into RREF by systematically applying row operations, ensuring all pivot positions are 1 and other entries in pivot columns are zero, while handling edge cases such as zero rows and reducible matrices."}

{"task_id": 51, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement the Optimal String Alignment (OSA) distance, which is a variant of the Damerau-Levenshtein distance. The OSA distance allows for insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions of adjacent characters, but unlike the full Damerau-Levenshtein distance, it does not allow for multiple edits on the same substring. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Create a matrix `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the OSA distance between the first `i` characters of the source string and the first `j` characters of the target string.\n2. **Base Cases**: \n   - If the source string is empty, the distance is the length of the target string (all insertions).\n   - If the target string is empty, the distance is the length of the source string (all deletions).\n3. **Filling the DP Matrix**:\n   - For each character in the source and target strings, compute the cost based on insertions, deletions, and substitutions.\n   - Additionally, check for transpositions (adjacent swaps).

The extra row and column account for the empty string cases.\n2. **Base Cases**: The first row and column of the matrix are filled with values representing the number of insertions or deletions needed to transform an empty string into the target string or vice versa.\n3. **DP Matrix Filling**: For each character position `(i, j)` in the matrix:\n   - If the characters `source[i-1]` and `target[j-1]` match, the cost is 0; otherwise, the substitution cost is 1.\n   - The value `dp[i][j]` is computed as the minimum of the costs of deletion, insertion, or substitution from the previous positions.\n   - If a transposition is detected (i.e., the current and previous characters in both strings are swapped), the cost is updated to consider the transposition operation, which involves looking back two characters in both strings.\n4. **Result**: The value at `dp[m][n]` gives the OSA distance between the source and target strings, representing the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the OSA distance by leveraging dynamic programming to explore all possible edit operations while checking for adjacent transpositions, ensuring optimal performance and correctness."}

{"task_id": 55, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that applies a 2D translation matrix to a set of points. The translation matrix will move each point by a specified distance in the x and y directions. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Translation Matrix**: In 2D space, translating a point (x, y) by distances tx and ty involves adding tx to x and ty to y. This can be represented using matrix operations. The translation matrix for homogeneous coordinates is a 3x3 matrix, but since we are dealing with standard 2D coordinates, we can simply add the translation values to each coordinate.\n2. **Convert Points to NumPy Array**: For efficient computation, we will convert the list of points into a NumPy array. This allows us to handle operations on all points simultaneously.\n3. **Apply Translation**: For each point (x, y) in the array, we add tx to x and ty to y. This can be done efficiently using NumPy's vectorized operations.\n4. **Return Result as a List**: After applying the translation, we convert the NumPy array back to a Python list and return it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef translate_object(points, tx, ty):\n    # Convert the list of points to a NumPy array for easier manipulation\n    points_array = np.array(points)\n    # Apply translation by adding tx to x and ty to y for each point\n    translated_points = points_array + np.array([tx, ty])\n    # Convert the result back to a list of lists\n    return translated_points.tolist()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Conversion to NumPy Array**: The input `points` is converted into a NumPy array to leverage NumPy's efficient array operations.\n2. **Translation Application**: The translation values `tx` and `ty` are added to each point's x and y coordinates respectively. This is done in a vectorized manner, which means the operation is applied to all points simultaneously without the need for explicit loops.\n3. **Conversion Back to List**: The translated points, still in NumPy array form, are converted back to a Python list of lists using the `tolist()` method to meet the output constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the translation of multiple points by utilizing NumPy's vectorized operations, ensuring clarity and performance. The solution is concise and leverages NumPy's capabilities to simplify the translation process."}

This helps in determining how common or rare the term is across the corpus.\n3. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) Calculation**: Using the DF values, compute the IDF for each term. Smoothing is applied to avoid division by zero by adding 1 to both the numerator (total documents + 1) and denominator (DF + 1).

A higher beta gives more weight to recall, while a lower beta gives more weight to precision.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f_score(y_true, y_pred, beta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate F-Score for a binary classification task.\n\n    :param y_true: Numpy array of true labels\n    :param y_pred: Numpy array of predicted labels\n    :param beta: The weight of precision in the harmonic mean\n    :return: F-Score rounded to three decimal places\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate True Positives, False Positives, and False Negatives\n    tp = np.sum((y_true == 1) & (y_pred == 1))\n    fp = np.sum((y_true == 0) & (y_pred == 1))\n    fn = np.sum((y_true == 1) & (y_pred == 0))\n    \n    # Calculate Precision and Recall\n    precision = tp / (tp + fp) if (tp + fp) != 0 else 0\n    recall = tp / (tp + fn) if (tp + fn) != 0 else 0\n    \n    # Calculate F-Score\n    if (beta**2 * precision + recall) == 0:\n        f_score_value = 0\n    else:\n        f_score_value = (1 + beta**2) * (precision * recall) / (beta**2 * precision + recall)\n    \n    return round(f_score_value, 3)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **True Positives (TP)**: These are instances where both the true label and the predicted label are 1. We calculate this by using a logical AND between `y_true` and `y_pred` for the positive class.\n2. **False Positives (FP)**: These are instances where the true label is 0 but the predicted label is 1. This is found by checking where `y_true` is 0 and `y_pred` is 1.\n3. **False Negatives (FN)**: These are instances where the true label is 1 but the predicted label is 0. This is found by checking where `y_true` is 1 and `y_pred` is 0.\n4. **Precision and Recall**: Precision is the ratio of TP to all predicted positives (TP + FP). Recall is the ratio of TP to all actual positives (TP + FN). Both metrics are protected against division by zero.\n5. **F-Score Calculation**: The F-Score is computed using the given formula, which adjusts the balance between precision and recall based on the beta parameter. If both precision and recall are zero, the F-Score is zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n6. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to three decimal places for readability and consistency.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the F-Score by first deriving the necessary components (TP, FP, FN) and then applying the formula, ensuring robustness against edge cases like division by zero."}

For the example above, probabilities would be `[1/6, 2/6, 3/6]`.\n- **np.sum(probabilities ** 2)**: This sums the squares of the probabilities. For the example, it would be `(1/6)^2 + (2/6)^2 + (3/6)^2 = 1/36 + 4/36 + 9/36 = 14/36 \u2248 0.3889`.\n- **gini = 1 - sum**: Subtracting this sum from 1 gives the Gini impurity.

The CSR format consists of three arrays: the values array, the column indices array, and the row pointer array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Values Array**: This array will store all the non-zero elements of the matrix in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom).\n2. **Column Indices Array**: For each non-zero element in the values array, this array stores the column index of that element in the original matrix.\n3. **Row Pointer Array**: This array has a length equal to the number of rows plus one. Each entry at index `i` in this array indicates the start of the `i-th` row's data in the values and column indices arrays. The last entry is the total number of non-zero elements.\n\nThe steps to construct these arrays are as follows:\n1. **Initialize the arrays**: We start with empty lists for values, column indices, and a row pointer array initialized with 0.\n2. **Iterate through each row**: For each row in the dense matrix, count the non-zero elements.\n3. **Process each element in the row**: For each non-zero element encountered, add its value to the values array and its column index to the column indices array.\n4. **Update the row pointer array**: After processing each row, update the row pointer array by adding the count of non-zero elements in the current row to the previous cumulative count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compressed_row_sparse_matrix(dense_matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert a dense matrix to its Compressed Row Sparse (CSR) representation.\n\n    :param dense_matrix: 2D list representing a dense matrix\n    :return: A tuple containing (values array, column indices array, row pointer array)\n    \"\"\"\n    values = []\n    column_indices = []\n    row_ptr = [0]  # The first element is always 0\n    \n    for row in dense_matrix:\n        non_zero_count = 0\n        for col_idx, element in enumerate(row):\n            if element != 0:\n                values.append(element)\n                column_indices.append(col_idx)\n                non_zero_count += 1\n        row_ptr.append(row_ptr[-1] + non_zero_count)\n    \n    return (values, column_indices, row_ptr)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The `values` and `column_indices` lists start empty. The `row_ptr` list starts with a single element, 0, which will be built upon as we process each row.\n2. **Processing Each Row**: For each row in the input matrix, we check each element. If an element is non-zero, its value is added to `values`, and its column index is added to `column_indices`.\n3. **Updating Row Pointers**: After processing each row, the total number of non-zero elements encountered so far is added to `row_ptr`. This helps in knowing where each row's data starts and ends in the values and column indices arrays.\n4. **Result Construction**: The function returns a tuple containing the three arrays: `values`, `column_indices`, and `row_ptr`.

It also calculates the dot product of **L** with itself (`dot_product_LL`), which is the squared magnitude of **L**.\n2. **Zero Vector Check**: If **L** is a zero vector (i.e., `dot_product_LL` is zero), the function returns a zero vector of the same length as **L** since projecting any vector onto a zero vector is undefined, and conventionally results in a zero vector.\n3. **Scalar Projection**: The scalar value is computed by dividing `dot_product_vL` by `dot_product_LL`. This scalar determines the length of the projection of **v** onto **L**.\n4. **Projection Vector**: The projection vector is obtained by multiplying each component of **L** by the scalar value. This results in a vector that lies along **L**.\n5. **Rounding**: Each component of the projection vector is rounded to three decimal places to meet the specified output requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the orthogonal projection using fundamental vector operations and handles edge cases such as a zero vector in **L**.

The starting index of the first column is 0, and each subsequent column's starting index is the previous column's starting index plus the number of non-zero elements in the previous column.\n\n3. **Construct Column Pointer**: The `column_pointer` array starts with 0. For each column, the next entry in `column_pointer` is the previous entry plus the number of non-zero elements found in that column. The last entry in `column_pointer` is the total number of non-zero elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compressed_col_sparse_matrix(dense_matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert a dense matrix into its Compressed Column Sparse (CSC) representation.\n\n    :param dense_matrix: List of lists representing the dense matrix\n    :return: Tuple of (values, row indices, column pointer)\n    \"\"\"\n    if not dense_matrix:\n        return [], [], []\n    \n    rows = len(dense_matrix)\n    cols = len(dense_matrix[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    values = []\n    row_indices = []\n    column_pointer = [0]  # The first column starts at index 0\n    \n    for col in range(cols):\n        non_zero_in_col = 0\n        for row in range(rows):\n            val = dense_matrix[row][col]\n            if val != 0:\n                values.append(val)\n                row_indices.append(row)\n                non_zero_in_col += 1\n        column_pointer.append(column_pointer[-1] + non_zero_in_col)\n    \n    return (values, row_indices, column_pointer)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Checks**: The function first checks if the input matrix is empty and returns empty lists if true.\n2. **Matrix Dimensions**: The number of rows and columns in the dense matrix is determined. This helps in iterating through each element of the matrix.\n3. **Processing Columns**: For each column, the function scans each row. If a non-zero value is found, it is added to the `values` list, and its row index is added to `row_indices`. The count of non-zero elements in the column is tracked.\n4. **Column Pointer Construction**: The `column_pointer` list is built by accumulating the counts of non-zero elements in each column. Each subsequent entry in `column_pointer` is the sum of the previous entry and the non-zero count of the current column. The last entry in `column_pointer` gives the total number of non-zero elements in the matrix.\n5. **Return Result**: The function returns the three lists `values`, `row_indices`, and `column_pointer` as a tuple, which together form the CSC representation of the input dense matrix.\n\nThis approach efficiently compresses the matrix by only storing non-zero elements and their positions, which is particularly useful for sparse matrices where most elements are zero. The column-major order ensures that the CSC format is optimized for column operations."}

This process will help identify the pivot columns, which correspond to the linearly independent columns in the original matrix.\n2. **Identify Pivot Columns**: The pivot columns in the RREF matrix are the columns that contain the leading 1's (pivots) in each row. These pivot columns indicate which columns in the original matrix \\( A \\) are linearly independent.\n3. **Extract Basis Vectors**: The columns in the original matrix \\( A \\) that correspond to the pivot columns in the RREF form the basis for the column space of \\( A \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef matrix_image(A):\n    # Convert the input to a numpy array for processing\n    A_array = np.array(A, dtype=float)\n    \n    # Compute the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of the matrix\n    # We'll use a custom RREF function or a method from a library\n    # Here, we'll use sympy's rref for precise computation, but since sympy is not in the standard libraries, we'll implement a basic RREF\n    \n    # Implementing a basic RREF function\n    def rref(matrix):\n        # Make a copy of the matrix to avoid modifying the original\n        mat = matrix.copy()\n        rows, cols = mat.shape\n        r = 0  # current row\n        pivot_cols = []\n        \n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Find the pivot row\n            pivot = np.argmax(np.abs(mat[r:, c])) + r\n            if np.isclose(mat[pivot, c], 0):\n                continue  # Skip if the column is all zeros\n            \n            # Swap the current row with the pivot row\n            mat[[r, pivot]] = mat[[pivot, r]]\n            pivot_cols.append(c)\n            \n            # Normalize the current row\n            mat[r] = mat[r] / mat[r, c]\n            \n            # Eliminate all other rows\n            for i in range(rows):\n                if i != r and not np.isclose(mat[i, c], 0):\n                    mat[i] = mat[i] - mat[i, c] * mat[r]\n            \n            r += 1\n            if r == rows:\n                break\n        return mat, pivot_cols\n    \n    rref_mat, pivot_cols = rref(A_array)\n    \n    # The basis for the column space are the columns of the original matrix corresponding to pivot columns\n    basis = A_array[:, pivot_cols]\n    \n    # Round to 8 decimal places and convert to list\n    basis_rounded = np.round(basis, 8)\n    return basis_rounded.tolist()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **RREF Computation**: The `rref` function transforms the matrix into its reduced row echelon form. This involves iterating over each column to find the pivot (the first non-zero element in the column), swapping rows to position the pivot, normalizing the pivot row, and eliminating other entries in the pivot column.\n2. **Pivot Columns Identification**: The columns in the RREF matrix that contain pivots (leading 1's) are noted. These columns indicate the linearly independent columns in the original matrix.\n3. **Basis Extraction**: The corresponding columns from the original matrix \\( A \\) (not the RREF matrix) are selected to form the basis of the column space.

The Jaccard Index is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the two sets. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Validation**: Ensure that the input arrays `y_true` and `y_pred` are of the same length. However, the problem statement assumes they are binary arrays of the same length, so we proceed under that assumption.\n2. **Intersection Calculation**: The intersection of `y_true` and `y_pred` is the set of elements where both arrays have a value of 1.

{"task_id": 74, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to generate a composite hypervector for a given dataset row using Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). The approach involves creating hypervectors for each feature name and its corresponding value, binding them together, and then bundling all these bound hypervectors into a single composite hypervector. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Generate Hypervectors for Feature Names and Values**: For each feature in the row, we will generate two hypervectors: one for the feature name and one for the feature value. The hypervectors should be random binary vectors (or bipolar vectors, commonly +1 and -1) of a given dimension. The randomness for the value hypervectors should be controlled by the seed provided in `random_seeds` for each feature.\n2. **Binding Hypervectors**: The binding operation typically involves element-wise multiplication (XOR for binary vectors) of the feature name hypervector and the value hypervector. This creates a new hypervector that represents the conjunction of the feature and its value.\n3. **Bundling Hypervectors**: The bundling operation is usually an element-wise addition of all the bound hypervectors followed by thresholding (for binary vectors) or normalization (for bipolar vectors). Here, we will use element-wise addition and then apply a sign function to convert the result back to a bipolar vector.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef create_row_hv(row, dim, random_seeds):\n    composite_hv = np.zeros(dim)\n    \n    for feature_name, value in row.items():\n        # Generate hypervector for the feature name using a fixed seed derived from the feature name's hash\n        feature_seed = hash(feature_name) % (2**32)\n        np.random.seed(feature_seed)\n        feature_hv = np.random.choice([-1, 1], size=dim)\n        \n        # Generate hypervector for the value using the provided seed for the feature\n        value_seed = random_seeds[feature_name]\n        np.random.seed(value_seed)\n        value_hv = np.random.choice([-1, 1], size=dim)\n        \n        # Binding is element-wise multiplication\n        bound_hv = feature_hv * value_hv\n        \n        # Bundling is element-wise addition\n        composite_hv += bound_hv\n    \n    # Normalize the composite hypervector by taking the sign (convert back to bipolar)\n    composite_hv = np.sign(composite_hv)\n    # Replace zeros (if any) with 1 or -1 (though unlikely for large dim)\n    composite_hv[composite_hv == 0] = 1  # or could randomly choose\n    \n    return composite_hv.tolist()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The composite hypervector is initialized as a zero vector of the specified dimension.\n2. **Feature Name Hypervector Generation**: For each feature name, a hypervector is generated using a seed derived from the feature name's hash. This ensures reproducibility for the same feature names across different runs.\n3. **Value Hypervector Generation**: The value hypervector is generated using the seed provided in `random_seeds` for the corresponding feature. This ensures that the same value for a feature always produces the same hypervector.\n4. **Binding Operation**: The binding of the feature name hypervector and the value hypervector is performed via element-wise multiplication. This operation combines the two hypervectors into a single representation that encodes their conjunction.\n5. **Bundling Operation**: The bound hypervectors for all features are summed element-wise. The resulting vector is then converted back to a bipolar vector using the sign function, which replaces each element with +1 or -1. Any zeros (which can occur if there's an exact balance of +1 and -1 additions) are replaced with +1 as a default.\n6. **Output**: The final composite hypervector is converted to a list and returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently combines all features of a row into a single hypervector that can be used for further HDC operations like classification or similarity measurement. The use of seeds ensures reproducibility, which is crucial for consistent results in machine learning tasks."}

These values are derived by comparing the actual and predicted labels.\n2. **Accuracy**: This is the proportion of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) out of all predictions. It is calculated as (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN).\n3. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. Precision is TP / (TP + FP), and recall (also called sensitivity) is TP / (TP + FN).

These counts are then structured into a 2x2 matrix.\n2. **Accuracy Calculation**: The sum of correct predictions (TP + TN) divided by the total number of predictions gives the accuracy. This value is rounded to three decimal places.\n3. **F1 Score Calculation**: The F1 score is derived from precision and recall. Precision is the ratio of TP to all predicted positives (TP + FP), and recall is the ratio of TP to all actual positives (TP + FN). The harmonic mean of these values gives the F1 score, which is then rounded.\n4. **Specificity Calculation**: Specificity is the ratio of TN to all actual negatives (TN + FP), rounded to three decimal places.\n5. **Negative Predictive Value (NPV) Calculation**: NPV is the ratio of TN to all predicted negatives (TN + FN), also rounded to three decimal places.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes each metric by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and conditional checks to handle division by zero, ensuring robustness and correctness."}

The problem specifies that a difference greater than 0.2 between training and test accuracy indicates overfitting. This condition should be checked first because it takes precedence over underfitting.\n2. **Check for Underfitting**: Underfitting is identified when both the training and test accuracies are below 0.7.

{"task_id": 89, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a simplified self-attention mechanism for a sequence of crystal values. The self-attention mechanism involves calculating attention scores between each crystal and every other crystal in the sequence, applying the softmax function to these scores, and then using these scores to compute a weighted sum of the crystal values. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Softmax Function**: The softmax function converts a vector of values into a probability distribution. Each value in the vector is transformed such that the sum of all transformed values is 1. The softmax of a value \\( x_i \\) in a vector \\( \\mathbf{x} \\) is computed as \\( \\text{softmax}(x_i) = \\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\sum_{j} e^{x_j}} \\).\n\n2. **Attention Scores Calculation**: For each crystal in the sequence, we need to compute its relationship (attention score) with every other crystal. In a simplified self-attention mechanism, these relationships can be modeled as the dot product of the crystal values. However, since the problem does not specify how to compute these relationships, we'll assume that the attention score between two crystals is simply the product of their values. \n\n3. **Weighted Sum**: For each crystal, the attention scores (after applying softmax) are used to compute a weighted sum of all crystal values. This weighted sum represents the enhanced pattern for that crystal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef pattern_weaver(n, crystal_values, dimension):\n    def softmax(values):\n        exp_values = np.exp(values - np.max(values))  # Subtract max for numerical stability\n        return exp_values / np.sum(exp_values)\n    \n    # Assuming the attention scores are computed as the product of crystal values\n    # Create a matrix where each element (i, j) is crystal_values[i] * crystal_values[j]\n    attention_scores = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            attention_scores[i, j] = crystal_values[i] * crystal_values[j]\n    \n    # Apply softmax to each row of the attention_scores matrix\n    softmax_scores = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        softmax_scores[i] = softmax(attention_scores[i])\n    \n    # Compute the weighted sum for each crystal\n    enhanced_patterns = np.zeros(n)\n    for i in range(n):\n        weighted_sum = 0.0\n        for j in range(n):\n            weighted_sum += softmax_scores[i, j] * crystal_values[j]\n        enhanced_patterns[i] = weighted_sum\n    \n    # Round to 4 decimal places\n    enhanced_patterns_rounded = [round(val, 4) for val in enhanced_patterns]\n    return enhanced_patterns_rounded\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Softmax Function**: The `softmax` function is implemented to handle numerical stability by subtracting the maximum value in the input array before exponentiation. This prevents large exponentials which can cause overflow.\n2. **Attention Scores Calculation**: The attention scores matrix is constructed where each element (i, j) is the product of the i-th and j-th crystal values. This represents the raw attention scores before normalization.\n3. **Softmax Application**: Each row of the attention scores matrix is passed through the softmax function to convert the scores into probabilities that sum to 1. This step ensures that the attention weights are normalized.\n4. **Weighted Sum Calculation**: For each crystal, the enhanced pattern is computed as the sum of all crystal values weighted by the corresponding softmax scores. This results in a new sequence where each crystal's value is a weighted combination of all crystal values based on their attention relationships.\n5. **Rounding**: The final enhanced patterns are rounded to four decimal places to meet the output constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently models the self-attention mechanism by leveraging simple dot products for attention scores and softmax normalization, providing a clear and interpretable enhancement of the original crystal values."}

The model will be of the form \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(x\\) is the day number and \\(y\\) is the detrended consumption.\n3. **Predict Base Consumption for Day 15**: Use the linear regression model to predict the base consumption (without fluctuation) for day 15.\n4. **Add Fluctuation for Day 15**: Compute the fluctuation for day 15 using the same formula and add it to the predicted base consumption.\n5. **Apply Safety Margin**: Multiply the result by 1.05 (5% safety margin) and round it up to the nearest integer to ensure the colony's future needs are met.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\nPI = 3.14159\n\ndef power_grid_forecast(consumption_data):\n    # Step 1: Subtract the daily fluctuation from each data point\n    detrended_data = []\n    for i in range(len(consumption_data)):\n        day = i + 1  # days are 1-based\n        fluctuation = 10 * math.sin(2 * PI * day / 10)\n        detrended_value = consumption_data[i] - fluctuation\n        detrended_data.append(detrended_value)\n    \n    # Step 2: Perform linear regression on detrended_data (y) vs day numbers (x)\n    n = len(detrended_data)\n    x_sum = 0\n    y_sum = 0\n    xy_sum = 0\n    x_sq_sum = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        x = i + 1  # day numbers are 1-based\n        y = detrended_data[i]\n        x_sum += x\n        y_sum += y\n        xy_sum += x * y\n        x_sq_sum += x * x\n    \n    # Calculate slope (m) and intercept (b) for y = mx + b\n    m = (n * xy_sum - x_sum * y_sum) / (n * x_sq_sum - x_sum * x_sum)\n    b = (y_sum - m * x_sum) / n\n    \n    # Step 3: Predict day 15's base consumption (without fluctuation)\n    day_15 = 15\n    base_consumption = m * day_15 + b\n    \n    # Step 4: Add the day 15 fluctuation back\n    fluctuation_15 = 10 * math.sin(2 * PI * day_15 / 10)\n    total_consumption = base_consumption + fluctuation_15\n    \n    # Step 5: Add 5% safety margin and round up to nearest integer\n    safety_margin = 1.05\n    final_value = math.ceil(total_consumption * safety_margin)\n    \n    # Step 6: Return the final integer\n    return int(final_value)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Detrending the Data**: The given consumption data includes both a linear trend and a sinusoidal fluctuation. For each day \\(i\\), the fluctuation \\(10 \\times \\sin(2\\pi i / 10)\\) is subtracted from the observed consumption to isolate the linear trend.\n2. **Linear Regression**: The detrended data is used to fit a linear regression model. The model parameters (slope \\(m\\) and intercept \\(b\\)) are calculated using the least squares method, which minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.\n3. **Prediction for Day 15**: Using the linear model \\(y = mx + b\\), the base consumption for day 15 is predicted. The sinusoidal fluctuation for day 15 is then added back to this prediction.\n4. **Safety Margin**: The total predicted consumption for day 15 is increased by 5% to account for uncertainties, and the result is rounded up to the nearest integer to ensure sufficient energy supply.\n\nThis approach efficiently separates the known periodic fluctuation from the underlying linear trend, allowing accurate future predictions with a safety buffer."}
{"task_id": 93, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a function that calculates the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between two arrays of actual and predicted values. The MAE is a common metric used to evaluate the accuracy of predictions in regression models. It measures the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted and actual values, without considering the direction of the errors.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Formula**: The MAE is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted values and the actual values. The formula for MAE is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{MAE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_{\\text{true}}^{(i)} - y_{\\text{pred}}^{(i)}|\n   \\]\n   where \\( n \\) is the number of observations, \\( y_{\\text{true}} \\) is the array of actual values, and \\( y_{\\text{pred}} \\) is the array of predicted values.\n\n2. **Check Input Validity**: Ensure that the input arrays `y_true` and `y_pred` are of the same length. If they are not, the function should raise a ValueError because it's not possible to compute element-wise differences between arrays of different lengths.\n\n3. **Compute Absolute Errors**: For each pair of elements in `y_true` and `y_pred`, compute the absolute difference between them.\n\n4. **Calculate the Mean**: Sum all the absolute differences and divide by the number of elements to get the mean.\n\n5. **Round the Result**: Round the resulting mean to three decimal places for better readability and consistency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef mae(y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate Mean Absolute Error between two arrays.\n\n    Parameters:\n    y_true (numpy.ndarray): Array of true values\n    y_pred (numpy.ndarray): Array of predicted values\n\n    Returns:\n    float: Mean Absolute Error rounded to 3 decimal places\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the lengths of y_true and y_pred are not equal\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(y_true) != len(y_pred):\n        raise ValueError(\"The lengths of y_true and y_pred must be the same.\")\n    \n    absolute_errors = np.abs(y_true - y_pred)\n    mean_absolute_error = np.mean(absolute_errors)\n    return round(mean_absolute_error, 3)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the lengths of `y_true` and `y_pred` are the same.

This results in an array of absolute errors.\n3. **Mean Calculation**: The mean of these absolute errors is computed using NumPy's `mean` function, which sums all elements in the array and divides by the number of elements.\n4. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to three decimal places to ensure a clean and standardized output format.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages NumPy's vectorized operations for performance and clarity, ensuring accurate and robust computation of the MAE metric."}

The Phi coefficient is a measure of association between two binary variables, similar to the Pearson correlation coefficient for binary data. The formula for the Phi coefficient is derived from a 2x2 contingency table.

{"task_id": 108, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to measure the disorder in a basket of apples based on their colors. The disorder should be zero when all apples are the same color and should increase as the variety of colors increases. The solution should satisfy the given examples and constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Frequencies**: First, we need to count how many times each color appears in the basket. This helps us understand the distribution of colors.\n2. **Calculate Entropy**: A common method to measure disorder in probability distributions is entropy, which is defined as the sum of -p_i * log(p_i) for each probability p_i (where p_i is the proportion of the i-th color in the basket). Higher entropy indicates more disorder.\n3. **Normalization (Optional)**: Depending on the desired output, we might normalize the entropy to a certain range, but for this problem, using raw entropy should suffice as it naturally meets the given constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef disorder(apples: list) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a measure of disorder in a basket of apples based on their colors.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not apples:\n        return 0.0\n    \n    total_apples = len(apples)\n    color_counts = {}\n    \n    for color in apples:\n        color_counts[color] = color_counts.get(color, 0) + 1\n    \n    entropy = 0.0\n    for count in color_counts.values():\n        probability = count / total_apples\n        entropy -= probability * math.log(probability) if probability > 0 else 0\n    \n    return round(entropy, 4)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Frequency Counting**: The code first checks if the list of apples is empty. If it is, the disorder is zero. Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of each color using a dictionary.\n2. **Entropy Calculation**: For each color, the probability of encountering that color in the basket is calculated (count of the color divided by total number of apples). The entropy is then computed by summing the terms -p_i * log(p_i) for each color. This term is zero if p_i is zero (as log(0) is undefined, but the limit is handled by the condition).\n3. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to four decimal places to meet the output constraints.\n\n**Why Entropy?** Entropy is a measure of uncertainty or disorder in a system. In this context:\n- If all apples are the same color (probability 1), the entropy is zero because there is no uncertainty.\n- As the variety of colors increases and their distribution becomes more uniform, the entropy increases, reflecting higher disorder.\n- The examples provided align with this measure. For instance:\n  - [0,0,0,0] has entropy 0.\n  - [1,1,0,0] has entropy -2*(0.5 * log(0.5)) \u2248 0.6931.\n  - [0,1,2,3] has entropy -4*(0.25 * log(0.25)) \u2248 1.3863, which is higher than the previous case.\n  - [0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3] has entropy -4*(0.25 * log(0.25)) \u2248 1.3863, same as [0,1,2,3], but the problem statement expects [0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3] to have higher disorder than [0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3]. The latter's entropy is - (5/8 log(5/8) + 1/8 log(1/8) + 1/8 log(1/8) + 1/8 log(1/8)) \u2248 1.2130, which is indeed less than 1.3863. Thus, the entropy approach satisfies the given examples. \n\nThis approach effectively quantifies disorder in a way that meets all specified conditions."}

The number of chunks and the total matched unigrams help compute the fragmentation penalty.\n6. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty is based on the fragmentation (number of chunks) and is scaled by parameters beta and gamma.\n7. **Final Score Calculation**: The score is the F-mean multiplied by (1 - penalty), then rounded to three decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef meteor_score(reference, candidate, alpha=0.9, beta=3, gamma=0.5):\n    # Tokenize the reference and candidate into words\n    ref_words = reference.split()\n    cand_words = candidate.split()\n    \n    # Calculate unigram matches\n    ref_counts = Counter(ref_words)\n    cand_counts = Counter(cand_words)\n    \n    # Common unigrams\n    common_unigrams = ref_counts & cand_counts\n    matches = sum(common_unigrams.values())\n    \n    if matches == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    \n    # Precision and recall\n    precision = matches / len(cand_words)\n    recall = matches / len(ref_words)\n    \n    # F-mean\n    f_mean = (precision * recall) / (alpha * precision + (1 - alpha) * recall)\n    \n    # Chunk calculation\n    # Find the longest sequence of words in candidate that appear in the same order in reference\n    # This is a simplified approach; full implementation requires more complex alignment\n    # Here, we approximate by counting the number of chunks as the number of contiguous matches\n    # Initialize variables for chunk calculation\n    chunks = 0\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    len_ref = len(ref_words)\n    len_cand = len(cand_words)\n    \n    while i < len_cand and j < len_ref:\n        if cand_words[i] == ref_words[j]:\n            # Start of a potential chunk\n            start = i\n            # Try to extend the chunk as long as words match consecutively\n            while i < len_cand and j < len_ref and cand_words[i] == ref_words[j]:\n                i += 1\n                j += 1\n            chunks += 1\n        else:\n            # Move the candidate pointer if no match\n            if cand_words[i] not in ref_words:\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                # Move the reference pointer to find the next possible match\n                j += 1\n    \n    # Penalty calculation\n    penalty = gamma * ((chunks / matches) ** beta) if matches != 0 else 1.0\n    penalty = min(penalty, 1.0)\n    \n    # Final score\n    score = f_mean * (1 - penalty)\n    \n    return round(score, 3)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tokenization**: The reference and candidate sentences are split into individual words (unigrams) for comparison.\n2. **Unigram Matches**: The common words between the reference and candidate are counted using counters, which helps in determining how many words match exactly.\n3. **Precision and Recall**: Precision is the ratio of matched words to the total words in the candidate. Recall is the ratio of matched words to the total words in the reference. These metrics help understand the coverage and accuracy of the candidate translation.\n4. **F-mean**: This is a weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, where alpha (default 0.9) gives more weight to recall. This balances the importance of both metrics.\n5. **Chunk Calculation**: The code approximates the number of contiguous word sequences (chunks) in the candidate that appear in the same order in the reference. This helps in assessing how fragmented the matches are.\n6. **Penalty**: The penalty is computed based on the number of chunks relative to the total matches, raised to a power (beta) and scaled by gamma. A higher number of chunks increases the penalty, reducing the score.\n7. **Final Score**: The score is derived by adjusting the F-mean with the penalty, ensuring the result is between 0 and 1, then rounded to three decimal places for readability.\n\nThis approach efficiently combines precision, recall, and fragmentation penalties to provide a comprehensive evaluation metric for translation quality."}

If all values in the list are the same (i.e., min and max are equal), then the denominator in the normalization formula would be zero, leading to division by zero. In such cases, we can return a list of 0.0s or handle it appropriately. However, typically, normalization would result in all values being 0.5, but the standard approach is to return 0.0 for each element to avoid division by zero.\n2. **Compute Min and Max**: Find the minimum and maximum values in the list.\n3. **Normalize Each Value**: For each value in the list, apply the Min-Max Normalization formula.\n4. **Round the Results**: Round each normalized value to 4 decimal places.\n5. **Return the Result**: Return the list of normalized and rounded values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_max(x: list[int]) -> list[float]:\n    if not x:\n        return []\n    min_val = min(x)\n    max_val = max(x)\n    if min_val == max_val:\n        return [0.0 for _ in x]\n    normalized = [(val - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for val in x]\n    return [round(num, 4) for num in normalized]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Edge Handling**: The function first checks if the input list is empty and returns an empty list immediately if so.\n2. **Min and Max Calculation**: The minimum and maximum values of the list are computed to determine the range of the data.\n3. **Uniform Value Handling**: If all values in the list are the same (min equals max), the function returns a list of 0.0s to avoid division by zero.

{"task_id": 120, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Bhattacharyya distance between two discrete probability distributions. The Bhattacharyya distance measures the similarity between two probability distributions and is derived from the Bhattacharyya coefficient. The formula for the Bhattacharyya distance involves taking the natural logarithm of the sum of the square roots of the product of the corresponding probabilities from the two distributions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Edge Cases**: \n   - If either of the input lists `p` or `q` is empty, return 0.0.\n   - If the lengths of `p` and `q` are different, return 0.0.\n2. **Calculate the Bhattacharyya Coefficient**: \n   - For each pair of corresponding probabilities in `p` and `q`, compute the square root of their product and sum these values across all pairs. This sum is the Bhattacharyya coefficient.\n3. **Compute the Bhattacharyya Distance**: \n   - The Bhattacharyya distance is given by the negative natural logarithm of the Bhattacharyya coefficient. If the coefficient is zero (which can happen if all products are zero), the distance would be infinite, but in practice, we handle it by returning a large number or zero, but the problem constraints specify returning 0.0 for invalid inputs (which we've already handled).\n4. **Round the Result**: \n   - The result should be rounded to four decimal places for consistency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef bhattacharyya_distance(p: list[float], q: list[float]) -> float:\n    if len(p) == 0 or len(q) == 0 or len(p) != len(q):\n        return 0.0\n    \n    # Calculate the Bhattacharyya coefficient\n    bc = 0.0\n    for pi, qi in zip(p, q):\n        bc += np.sqrt(pi * qi)\n    \n    # Handle cases where bc is 0 to avoid log(0)\n    if bc <= 0:\n        return 0.0\n    \n    distance = -np.log(bc)\n    \n    return round(distance, 4)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Edge Handling**: The function first checks if either list is empty or if their lengths differ. If so, it returns 0.0 immediately, as specified.\n2. **Bhattacharyya Coefficient Calculation**: The coefficient is computed by summing the square roots of the products of corresponding probabilities from distributions `p` and `q`. This step leverages the mathematical property that the coefficient is maximized when the distributions are identical.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The Bhattacharyya distance is derived by taking the negative natural logarithm of the coefficient. This transformation converts the coefficient (which ranges between 0 and 1) into a distance metric (ranging from 0 to infinity), where smaller values indicate more similar distributions.\n4. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to four decimal places to meet the output constraints, ensuring consistency and readability.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the computation while addressing potential edge cases and ensuring numerical stability, providing an accurate and robust implementation of the Bhattacharyya distance metric."}

This is because each output element is computed as a dot product between an input vector and a weight vector, involving `d_in` multiplications and `d_in - 1` additions (approximately `2 * d_in` operations per output element, and `d_out` such elements).\n\n2. **MoE Layer FLOPs**: In an MoE layer with `n_experts` experts, only `k_active` experts are active per input. Each expert is essentially a dense layer with input dimension `d_in` and output dimension `d_out`. The FLOPs for the MoE layer include:\n   - **Expert Computation**: `k_active * 2 * d_in * d_out` (since each active expert performs the same operations as a dense layer).\n   - **Gating Network**: The gating network's FLOPs are typically negligible compared to the expert computations, especially when the gating network is small (e.g., a single linear layer followed by softmax).

Thus, the total FLOPs for the MoE layer is `k_active` times the FLOPs of a single dense layer.\n- **Savings Percentage**: The savings are derived by comparing the MoE FLOPs to the dense FLOPs.
