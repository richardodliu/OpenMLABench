We first check if the number of columns in the matrix (`len(a[0])`) equals the length of the vector (`len(b)`). If not, we return -1 immediately.\n2. We initialize an empty list `result` to store the resulting vector.\n3. We iterate over each row in the matrix using a `for` loop.\n4. For each row, we compute the dot product of the row with the vector using a generator expression. We use the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of the row and the vector in parallel.\n5. We append the dot product to the `result` list.\n6. Finally, we return the `result` list, which represents the resulting vector.\n\nExample use cases:\n```python\n# Valid example\nmatrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\nvector = [7, 8, 9]\nresult = matrix_dot_vector(matrix, vector)\nprint(result)  # [30, 59]\n\n# Invalid example\nmatrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\nvector = [5, 6, 7]\nresult = matrix_dot_vector(matrix, vector)\nprint(result)  # -1\n```\nNote that the function returns a list of floats, even if the dot product is an integer. If you want to return a list of integers only, you can modify the function to use the `int` function to convert the dot product to an integer."}

We first convert the input list to a numpy array using `np.array(a)`.\n2. We then check if the array can be reshaped into the desired shape by comparing its shape with the new shape using `arr.shape!= new_shape`. If they are not equal, we return an empty list.\n3. If the array can be reshaped, we use the `reshape` method to reshape it into the desired shape. We then convert the reshaped array back to a list using `tolist()`.\n4.

We first check if the mode is valid. If it's not 'row' or 'column', we raise a ValueError.\n2. If the mode is 'row', we use list comprehension to calculate the mean of each row. We sum up the elements of each row using the `sum` function and divide by the number of elements in the row using `len(row)`.\n3. If the mode is 'column', we transpose the matrix using the `zip(*matrix)` trick, which returns an iterator of tuples where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables.

We initialize a 2D array `dp` with shape `(m + 1, n + 1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the source and target strings, respectively.\n2. We fill in the base cases: `dp[i, 0] = i` and `dp[0, j] = j`, which represent the minimum edit distance when one of the strings is empty.\n3. We iterate over the 2D array, calculating the minimum edit distance for each cell. We consider the following three operations:\n\t* Deletion: `dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j] + 1`\n\t* Insertion: `dp[i, j] = dp[i, j - 1] + 1`\n\t* Substitution: `dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + substitution_cost`, where `substitution_cost` is 0 if the characters at positions `i - 1` and `j - 1` are the same, and 1 otherwise.\n4. We also check for transposition: if the characters at positions `i - 1` and `j - 2` are the same, and the characters at positions `i - 2` and `j - 1` are the same, we can transpose them, which reduces the edit distance by 1.\n5. The OSA distance is stored in the bottom-right corner of the 2D array, `dp[m, n]`.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nsource = \"caper\"\ntarget = \"acer\"\nosa_distance = OSA(source, target)\nprint(oza_distance)  # Output: 2\n```\nNote that the OSA distance is equivalent to the Levenshtein distance, which is a measure of the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into the other."}

The function takes as input the coefficient matrix `A` and the right-hand side vector `b`, and returns the solution vector `x`. The solution is rounded to the nearest 4th decimal place using the `round()` function.\n\nNote that the Gaussian Elimination method is a row-echelon form transformation, which is then solved using back-substitution. The `np.argmax()` function is used to find the row with the largest absolute value in the current column, and the `np.swap()` function is used to swap the current row with the row with the largest absolute value. The pivot element is made equal to 1, and the pivot column is eliminated by subtracting the product of the pivot element and the current row from the other rows. The back-substitution is performed by iterating from the last row to the first row, and the solution is returned as a list."}

We first calculate the daily fluctuation using the formula `10 * sin(2\u03c0 * i / 10)`, where `i` is the day number (1 through 10). We store this in a list `fluctuation`.\n2. We then subtract the fluctuation from each data point using a list comprehension, resulting in the detrended data.\n3. We perform linear regression on the detrended data using NumPy's `lstsq` function, which returns the coefficients of the linear regression line. We store these coefficients in the `coefficients` variable.\n4. We predict day 15's base consumption by plugging the coefficients into the linear regression equation `y = coefficients[0] * x + coefficients[1]`, where `x` is 15.\n5. We add the day 15 fluctuation back to the predicted consumption.\n6. We round the result up to the nearest integer using `math.ceil` and add a 5% safety margin by multiplying by 1.05.\n\nNote that we use NumPy's `lstsq` function to perform the linear regression, which is more efficient and accurate than implementing the regression manually. We also use the `math` module for the sine and ceiling functions."}

This formula is derived from the original Tanh function, but with the added parameters `alpha`, `gamma`, and `beta` to control the behavior of the transformation.\n2. We use the `np.tanh` function to compute the hyperbolic tangent of the input `x`.\n3.
