It first checks if the determinant of `A` is zero. If it is, the function returns -1, indicating that the system has no unique solution. If the determinant of `A` is non-zero, the function calculates the solution for each variable by replacing the i-th column of `A` with `b` and calculating the determinant of the resulting matrix. The solution for the i-th variable is then the ratio of the determinant of the modified matrix to the determinant of `A`. The solutions are stored in a list, which is returned after being rounded to the nearest 4th decimal and reshaped into a Python list.\n"}
