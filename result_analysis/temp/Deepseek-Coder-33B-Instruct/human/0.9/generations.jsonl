The expected result is a 100x100 matrix, because we have 100 random variables each with 100 observations. The covariance matrix will be a 100x100 matrix, because the covariance between any two variables (or columns in this case) depends on their pairs of observations.\n"}

This consists of a set of experts, each responsible for a different subset of tasks. They found that dense networks with many parameters can be outperformed by MoE layers, but the trade-off is that the computational cost can be high. \n\nIn a dense layer, each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. This leads to n_in*n_out FLOPs for a single neuron, and for n_in neurons the total FLOPs are n_in*n_in* n_out. In a MoE layer, only a subset of the neurons interact with each input, so the total FLOPs can be significantly lower.\n\nHere is the Python script to calculate the computational efficiency:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_efficiency(n_experts, k_active, d_in, d_out):\n    # compute FLOPs for dense layer\n    dense_flops = d_in * d_out * n_experts\n\n    # compute FLOPs for MoE layer\n    moe_flops = d_in * d_out * k_active\n\n    # compute savings\n    savings = (dense_flops - moe_flops) / dense_flops * 100\n\n    # rounding to the nearest 1th decimal\n    dense_flops = round(dense_flops, 1)\n    moe_flops = round(moe_flops, 1)\n    savings = round(savings, 1)\n\n    return dense_flops, moe_flops, savings\n\n# example usage\ndense_flops, moe_flops, savings = compute_efficiency(1000, 10, 1024, 1024)\nprint(f\"Dense Layer FLOPs: {dense_flops}\")\nprint(f\"MoE Layer FLOPs: {moe_flops}\")\nprint(f\"Savings: {savings}%\")\n```\n\nThis script calculates the FLOPs for a dense layer as n_in*n_out*n_experts, and for a MoE layer as n_in*n_out*k_active, where k_active is the number of active experts.
