{"task_id": 127, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "In this task, you're required to find the minimum of the function $f(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 2$ using gradient descent. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that can be used to find the minimum of a function. To find the minimum, we start at a random position and take steps in the direction of the negative gradient. The size of these steps is determined by the learning rate. We stop when the change in $x$ is less than a certain tolerance.\n\nHere is the Python script that does this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_treasure(start_x: float, learning_rate: float = 0.1, tolerance: float = 1e-6, max_iters: int = 10000) -> float:\n    def f(x):\n        return x**4 - 3*x**3 + 2\n\n    def df(x):\n        return 4*x**3 - 9*x**2\n\n    x = start_x\n    for _ in range(max_iters):\n        gradient = df(x)\n        if abs(gradient) < tolerance:\n            break\n        x -= learning_rate * gradient\n\n    return round(x, 4)\n```\n\nYou can use this function to find the treasure. For example, to find the treasure starting at `start_x = 2.0`, you would call `find_treasure(2.0)`. This script uses the default learning rate and max iterations. If you want to change these, you can provide them as arguments to `find_treasure`. \n\nThis script rounds the result to the nearest 4th decimal place.\n\nNote: The choice of the starting point and learning rate can greatly affect the result. In some cases, the algorithm may not converge to the minimum, or it may converge to a different minimum.\n"}
