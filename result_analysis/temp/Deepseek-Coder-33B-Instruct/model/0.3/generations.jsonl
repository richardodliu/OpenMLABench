For each iteration, it computes the predictions, the residuals, and the gradients. It then updates the weights and bias according to the gradients and the learning rate. Finally, it returns the learned weights and bias, rounded to four decimal places.\n"}

The dot product of the input vector and the weight matrix of each layer is computed, and the ReLU activation function is applied to the result (except for the last layer, which does not have an activation function). Finally, the output of the network is returned, rounded to four decimal places.\n"}

Then, it repeats the following steps for at most `max_iters` iterations:\n\n1. It assigns every sample in `X` to the nearest centroid using the squared Euclidean distance.\n2. It updates each centroid to the arithmetic mean of the samples currently assigned to it.\n3. If all centroids move less than `1e-4` in a full iteration, it stops early.\n4. If a cluster becomes empty during an update, it keeps its centroid unchanged.\n\nAfter convergence, it sorts the centroids in ascending lexicographical order and rounds every coordinate to 4 decimal places. Finally, it returns the sorted, rounded centroids as a list of lists.\n"}
