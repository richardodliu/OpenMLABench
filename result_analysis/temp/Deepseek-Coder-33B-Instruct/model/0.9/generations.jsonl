{"task_id": 140, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "Here's a Python solution using Breadth-First Search (BFS). The idea is to simulate the spread of fire on a grid using a queue and then perform a BFS from the agent to the goal. We also use a separate grid to keep track of the shortest time to reach each cell:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef escape_fire_maze(grid: list[str]) -> int:\n    n = len(grid)\n    dirs = [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)] # directions to move, up, down, right, left\n\n    fire = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)] # grid to track when cells are on fire\n    agent = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)] # grid to track shortest time to reach each cell\n\n    fire_queue = deque() # queue for fire cells\n    agent_queue = deque() # queue for agent cells\n\n    # initialize fire and agent queues\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == \"F\":\n                fire_queue.append((i,j,0))\n            elif grid[i][j] == \".\":\n                agent_queue.append((i,j,0))\n\n    # spread fire\n    while fire_queue:\n        x, y, t = fire_queue.popleft()\n        fire[x][y] = t\n        for dx, dy in dirs:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] == \".\" and not fire[nx][ny] and not agent[nx][ny]:\n                fire_queue.append((nx, ny, t+1))\n\n    # move agent\n    while agent_queue:\n        x, y, t = agent_queue.popleft()\n        if (x, y) == (n-1, n-1): # reached goal\n            return t\n        agent[x][y] = t\n        for dx, dy in dirs:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] == \".\" and not fire[nx][ny] and not agent[nx][ny] and t+1 < fire[nx][ny]:\n                agent_queue.append((nx, ny, t+1))\n\n    # goal not reachable\n    return -1\n```\nThis solution has time complexity O(N^2) and space complexity also O(N^2) due to the use of two grids to store fire and agent grids. The simulation of fire propagation ensures that all cells can be reached no later than in `2*N` steps (one from each corner). Thus, the worst-case scenario is when the agent can move diagonally, and for each step she does, the fire spreads in the opposite direction.\n"}

The script first initializes `k` medoids, and then enters a loop in which it tries all possible single swaps between a medoid and a non-medoid, accepting the swap that strictly reduces the total cost the most. After the loop, it assigns each sample to the closest medoid and returns a list of these labels. The script uses the Euclidean distance as the cost function.\n\nPlease note that the script uses the scipy and sklearn libraries for distance calculations and matrix operations.

The bias term is added manually after that. An array of random weights is initialized, and then for every iteration, the model calculates the error and its gradients, and updates the weights using gradient descent. After `n_iterations` passes, the predictions for `x_test` are returned.\n\nThe script handles incompatible matrix shapes or non-positive iteration numbers gracefully by returning `-1`. Note that this implementation might have issues with numerical stability when scaling the features, and might suffer from bias in the estimates. You might consider using libraries like `scikit-learn` for production-level implementations of regression algorithms.\n"}

The points per class in the training and validation sets are specified by `n_train` and `n_val`, respectively. The data is generated independently for each class, and the coordinates of all points for a given class are sampled from the continuous uniform distribution on a square that is 8 units wide and centered on (base_x, base_y). The function returns a tuple of four NumPy arrays: `X_train`, `X_val`, `y_train`, and `y_val`. Each array contains the respective data points and labels.\n\nPlease note the use of `np.random.uniform` to generate uniform random numbers within the specified interval, and `np.full` to generate arrays filled with a constant value.
