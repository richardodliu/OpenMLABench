For single-dimensional action space, it checks whether it is continuous or discrete, and returns the suitable values. For multi-dimensional action space, it computes how many actions are possible in each dimension and, depending on whether it's continuous/discrete, returns the appropriate values. The return values are `n_actions_per_dim`, `action_ids` and `action_dim` in the given order. The function does not mutate its inputs and `action_stats` correctly handles both single- and multi-dimensional cases as well as continuous and discrete spaces.

It then assigns each sample to the cluster of the closest medoid. Note that it uses NumPy arrays and vectorized operations for efficiency. The output is a list of cluster labels for the samples in X.\n\nPlease note that the above code assumes that k is less than or equal to the number of samples in X and that X is a 2D NumPy array. If these conditions are not met, the code might return incorrect results or raise exceptions.\n\nLastly, the large constant factors in the time complexity can cause this code to be slow for large data sets, but it is a reasonably efficient implementation of the PAM clustering algorithm.\n\nI hope you find this helpful and feel free to ask if you have any other questions.\n"}

{"task_id": 413, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "Below is a Python implementation of the described problem. The code involves the calculation of the mean squared error for a given list of residuals, splitting the data at the best split point, creating tree nodes and links in a binary tree, calculating the node value as a mean of data samples in case of regressor, and finally the gradient boosting decision tree regressor function.\n\nThe logic is that first we initialize a zero array of predictions which length is the same as the number of samples in the training set. Then we iterate over a range of iterations which is equal to the number of estimators we want. Within each iteration, we calculate the negative gradients, which is the difference between the actual and the predicted values. Then, we apply the Mean Squared Error loss function to the negative gradients to get the residuals. We split this res_grad tuple into two list - one for residual and one for gradient corresponding to feature values in the training set. \n\nThen, we build the regression tree for the residuals. In each node, we try to split the data at every unique feature value, and choose the best split point which minimizes the sum of squared residuals. To construct the binary tree, we use recursive calls to the same function, which are terminated when maximum depth is reached or no splitting is possible. \n\nIn the regression tree node, the value is the mean value of the target variable in the node data. At end of each iteration, we update the initial predictions by adding the value in the regression tree for the data point multiplied by the learning rate. \n\nFinally, we return the final predictions using the learned regression tree.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef mse(y):\n    return np.sum((y - np.mean(y)) ** 2)\n\ndef split_data(x, y):\n    def split_mse(index, value):\n        left = y[x <= value]\n        right = y[x > value]\n        return mse(left) + mse(right)\n\n    unique = np.unique(x)\n    if len(unique) == 1:\n        return None, None, None, None\n\n    scores = np.array([split_mse(x, v) for v in unique])\n    index = np.argmin(scores)\n\n    return unique[index], y[x <= unique[index]], y[x > unique[index]]\n\ndef build_tree(x, y, depth=0):\n    if depth == 0:\n        global pred\n        pred = np.mean(y_train) * np.ones(len(x_train))\n\n    node = {'index': None, 'value': None, 'left': None, 'right': None, 'value': np.mean(y)}\n    if mse(y) != 0 and depth != max_depth:\n        best_mse = np.inf\n        for j in range(len(x[0])):\n            xj = x[:, j]\n            \n            value, left, right = split_data(xj, y)\n            \n            if mse(left) + mse(right) < best_mse:\n                node['index'] = j\n                node['value'] = value\n                node['left'] = build_tree(x[xj <= value], left, depth + 1)\n                node['right'] = build_tree(x[xj > value], right, depth + 1)\n                best_mse = mse(left) + mse(right)\n\n    return node\n\ndef predict(sample, tree):\n    while tree['index'] != None:\n        if sample[tree['index']] <= tree['value']:\n            tree = tree['left']\n        else:\n            tree = tree['right']\n    return tree['value']\n\ndef gbdt_regression(X_train: np.ndarray, y_train: np.ndarray, X_test: np.ndarray, n_estimators: int = 10, \n                    learning_rate: float = 0.1, max_depth: int = 3) -> list[float]:\n    global y_train, x_train, max_depth\n    y_train = y_train\n    x_train = X_train\n    max_depth = max_depth\n    \n    residuals = -(y_train - pred)\n    tree = build_tree(x_train, residuals)\n    \n    for _ in range(n_estimators):\n        residuals = -(y_train - pred)\n        tree = build_tree(x_train, residuals)\n        pred += np.array([predict(sample, tree) for sample in x_train]) * learning_rate\n    \n    return [round(predict(sample, tree), 4) for sample in X_test]\n``` \n\nThis Python script solves the problem by implementing a simplified Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) regressor from scratch using NumPy only.
