It separates the features and target from the input data, adds a bias term to the features, and then computes the weight vector.

It then initializes the dual parameters `alpha` and the bias `b` to zero. The algorithm then scans the samples in the order 0 \u2026 n-1. For each sample, it computes the activation and checks the margin. If the margin is less than or equal to zero, it means that the sample is mis-classified and the algorithm updates `alpha[i]` and `b`, and restarts the scan from the beginning. The algorithm stops when an entire pass over the data finishes without updating any samples or after `n_iter` updates. After training, it computes the primal weight vector `w` from the final `alpha`. Finally, it returns the weight vector and the bias, rounded to four decimal places.\n"}

It then uses a BFS to simulate the fire spreading and the agent's movement. The BFS is performed in two steps: first, fire spreads, then the agent moves. The depth of the BFS is the time it takes for the agent to escape. The helper function `is_valid` checks if a cell is inside the grid and not blocked. The helper function `spread_fire` spreads the fire to all its adjacent cells. The helper function `move_agent` moves the agent to all its adjacent cells if it is safe to do so.\n\nThe main BFS loop runs for `n*n` times, where `n` is the size of the grid. For each time step, the fire spreads first, then the agent moves. If the agent reaches the goal cell, the function returns the current time step. If the agent cannot reach the goal cell after `n*n` time steps, the function returns -1.\n"}

The script uses recursive function calls to build the tree and traverse it for predictions. The tree is built by greedy splitting on the single feature, selecting the split point that minimizes the sum of squared errors of the two children. The tree stops recursing when the current depth equals the user supplied max_depth or when a node contains fewer than two training samples.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, split_point=None, left=None, right=None, value=None):\n        self.split_point = split_point\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n        self.value = value\n\ndef build_tree(X, y, depth=0, max_depth=3):\n    if depth == max_depth or len(X) < 2:\n        return Node(value=np.mean(y))\n\n    split_point = None\n    min_error = float('inf')\n\n    for x in X:\n        left_idx = np.where(X < x)[0]\n        right_idx = np.where(X >= x)[0]\n\n        if len(left_idx) == 0 or len(right_idx) == 0:\n            continue\n\n        left_y = y[left_idx]\n        right_y = y[right_idx]\n\n        error = np.sum((left_y - np.mean(left_y))**2) + np.sum((right_y - np.mean(right_y))**2)\n\n        if error < min_error:\n            min_error = error\n            split_point = x\n\n    left_idx = np.where(X < split_point)[0]\n    right_idx = np.where(X >= split_point)[0]\n\n    left = build_tree(X[left_idx], y[left_idx], depth+1, max_depth)\n    right = build_tree(X[right_idx], y[right_idx], depth+1, max_depth)\n\n    return Node(split_point, left, right)\n\ndef predict(tree, X_test):\n    y_pred = []\n    for x in X_test:\n        node = tree\n        while node.split_point is not None:\n            if x < node.split_point:\n                node = node.left\n            else:\n                node = node.right\n        y_pred.append(node.value)\n    return y_pred\n\ndef regression_tree_predict(X_train, y_train, X_test, max_depth=3):\n    if len(X_train) == 0:\n        return []\n    X_train = np.array(X_train)\n    y_train = np.array(y_train)\n    tree = build_tree(X_train, y_train, max_depth=max_depth)\n    return predict(tree, X_test)\n```\n\nThe script first defines a Node class to represent the nodes of the tree. Then, it defines two functions: `build_tree` and `predict`. The `build_tree` function builds the tree by recursively splitting the data at the feature value that minimizes the sum of squared errors. The `predict` function traverses the tree to make predictions for the test data. Finally, the `regression_tree_predict` function ties everything together by building the tree and making predictions.\n"}

The `fp_growth` function takes a collection of transactions and a minimum support as input and returns all frequent item-sets sorted by their length and lexicographical order. The FP-tree is constructed by scanning the transaction database once, removing items that do not reach the minimum support, ordering the remaining items in each transaction by descending global frequency, and inserting each ordered transaction into an FP-tree. The header table is used to link every node that contains the same item label. The recursive mining stage generates conditional pattern bases from the header table, builds conditional FP-trees, and appends discovered single-items to the current prefix to create larger frequent item-sets. If a conditional tree consists of a single path, it enumerates all non-empty combinations of the items on that path and adds them to the result in one shot; otherwise, it continues mining the conditional tree recursively.\n"}
