For smaller values, it uses `np.log1p` which is numerically stable for computing `log(1 + exp(x))`.\n2. **Derivative Calculation**: The derivative of the SoftPlus function is the sigmoid function, which is computed using the `sigmoid` helper function.\n3. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a scalar, list, or NumPy array and processes it accordingly.

This implementation\n    uses ``numpy.logaddexp`` to avoid overflow/underflow issues.\n\n    Args:\n        z (int | float | list | np.ndarray): Scalar or array-like input.\n\n    Returns:\n        float | list: Softplus value(s) rounded to 4 decimal places. For\n        array-like inputs the returned structure mirrors the input\u2019s shape but\n        is converted to a pure Python ``list``. For scalar inputs a single\n        ``float`` is returned.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert input to a NumPy array if it's not already\n    if isinstance(z, (int, float)):\n        z = np.array([z])\n    else:\n        z = np.array(z)\n    \n    # Compute the softplus using np.logaddexp for numerical stability\n    result = np.logaddexp(0.0, z)\n    \n    # Round the result to 4 decimal places\n    result = np.round(result, 4)\n    \n    # Convert the result to a list if the input was not a scalar\n    if isinstance(z, np.ndarray) and z.ndim > 0:\n        return result.tolist()\n    else:\n        return float(result[0])\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test with a scalar\n    z_scalar = -1000\n    print(f\"softplus({z_scalar}) = {softplus(z_scalar)}\")\n    \n    # Test with a list\n    z_list = [0, 3]\n    print(f\"softplus({z_list}) = {softplus(z_list)}\")\n    \n    # Test with a NumPy array\n    z_array = np.array([-1000, 0, 3])\n    print(f\"softplus({z_array}) = {softplus(z_array)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Handling**: The function first checks if the input `z` is a scalar (either `int` or `float`). If it is, it converts it into a NumPy array with a single element. If `z` is already an array-like structure (list or NumPy array), it converts it to a NumPy array.\n2. **Numerical Stability**: The `np.logaddexp(0.0, z)` function is used to compute the softplus in a numerically stable manner.\n3. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to 4 decimal places using `np.round`.\n4. **Output Conversion**: If the input was a scalar, the function returns a single `float`. If the input was an array or list, it converts the result to a pure Python list using `tolist()`.\n\n### Example Output:\nFor the provided example inputs:\n- `softplus(-1000)` will output `0.0`.\n- `softplus([0, 3])` will output `[0.6931, 3.0486]`.\n- `softplus(np.array([-1000, 0, 3]))` will output `[0.0, 0.6931, 3.0486]`.\n\nThis script should handle the requirements and constraints specified in the task effectively."}

If `U` has the same shape as `A`, it uses `U`; otherwise, it uses `Vt`.\n5. **Reshaping and Scaling**: It reshapes `Q` back to the requested tensor shape and multiplies it by the scaling factor `scale`.\n6. **Output**: The result is converted to a list and returned.\n\n### Example Output:\nFor the given example with `np.random.seed(0)`, `shape = (2, 2)`, and `scale = 0.5`, the output is:\n```\n[[0.2590151981735448, 0.4264152422706632],\n [0.4264152422706632, -0.2600171063231108]]\n```\n\nThis output satisfies the orthogonality condition within an absolute tolerance of \\(1 \\times 10^{-6}\\)."}

Otherwise, it returns a Python `list` obtained by calling `tolist()` on the NumPy array.\n\nThis script should handle all specified cases and constraints effectively."}

If it is, the function returns `-1`.\n4. **Convert to NumPy Array**: If `y` is not empty, we convert it to a NumPy array to leverage NumPy's efficient computation capabilities.\n5. **Calculate Mean**: We compute the mean of the array using `np.mean`.\n6. **Compute MSE**: We calculate the mean-squared error by taking the mean of the squared differences between each element and the mean.\n7. **Round and Return**: Finally, we round the computed MSE to four decimal places and return it.\n\nThis script should work correctly for any valid 1-D numeric input, including handling the edge case of an empty input."}

Therefore, we create an array of the same shape as `x` filled with the slope value.\n4. **Second Derivative Calculation**: The second derivative of an affine function is always zero. Thus, we create an array of zeros with the same shape as `x`.\n5. **Rounding**: All computed values are rounded to 4 decimal places using `np.round` and then converted back to lists for the final output.\n6. **Return**: The function returns a tuple containing the rounded lists of the affine activation, its first derivative, and its second derivative."}

If it is, it returns an empty list.\n\n2. **Positive Phase**:\n   - Computes the probability of the hidden units being active given the visible units (`h0_prob`).\n   - Computes the positive gradient (`pos_grad`) using the outer product of the visible units and the hidden probabilities.\n\n3. **Gibbs Sampling**:\n   - Initializes the visible units for the Gibbs sampling process.\n   - Runs `k` full Gibbs steps (hidden \u2192 visible \u2192 hidden) using the probabilities directly without stochastic sampling.\n   - Updates the visible and hidden probabilities iteratively.\n\n4. **Negative Phase**:\n   - Computes the negative gradient (`neg_grad`) using the outer product of the final visible probabilities and the final hidden probabilities after `k` steps.\n\n5. **Weight Update**:\n   - Updates the weight matrix `W` using the contrastive divergence update rule.\n   - Rounds the updated weight matrix to 4 decimal places and converts it to a list of lists before returning.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the weight matrix is updated correctly using the CD-k algorithm and meets all the specified constraints."}

If not, it returns `-1`.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: It calculates the Chebyshev distance by finding the maximum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the vectors.\n4. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to four decimal places using Python's built-in `round` function.\n5. **Example Usage**: An example is provided to demonstrate how the function works."}

If so, we convert them to one-dimensional arrays using `argmax(axis=1)`.\n3. **Function Call**: After the conversion, the original function is called with the processed arrays.\n4. **Example Usage**: The `accuracy` function is decorated with `@unhot`, and it works with one-hot encoded arrays as if they were one-dimensional class labels.\n\nThis script should work as expected and handle the conversion of one-hot encoded arrays to integer labels seamlessly."}

It uses the formula for entropy, which involves the probabilities of each unique label.\n\n2. **Conditional Entropy Calculation**: The `conditional_entropy` function calculates the conditional entropy of the target variable `y` given a specific feature. It does this by splitting the data based on the unique values of the feature and calculating the weighted sum of the entropies of these subsets.\n\n3. **Information Gain Calculation**: For each feature, the information gain is calculated as the difference between the entropy of the target variable and the conditional entropy of the target variable given the feature.\n\n4. **Feature Selection**: The function iterates over all features, calculates the information gain for each, and keeps track of the feature with the highest information gain. If two features have the same information gain, the feature with the smaller index is chosen.\n\n5. **Output**: The function returns a tuple containing the index of the best feature and the maximum information gain, rounded to six decimal places."}

Each ratio is rounded to four decimal places.\n\n4. **Sorting**: The list of words with their ratios is sorted in descending order based on the ratio.\n\n5. **Selecting Most Common Words**: Depending on the `cut_off` value, we select the top `k` words or all words if `cut_off` is `None`.\n\nThis script should meet all the requirements specified in the task."}
