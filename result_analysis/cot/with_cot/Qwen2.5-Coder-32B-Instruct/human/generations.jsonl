Compute \\( A^T A \\).\n2. Use the Jacobian method to find the eigenvalues of \\( A^T A \\), which are the squares of the singular values.\n3. Compute the singular values by taking the square roots of the eigenvalues.\n4. Find the eigenvectors of \\( A^T A \\) to get the right singular vectors.\n5. Compute the left singular vectors using the relationship \\( U = AV \\Sigma^{-1} \\).\n\nBelow is the complete Python script implementing this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef svd_2x2_singular_values(A: np.ndarray) -> tuple:\n    # Step 1: Compute A^T A\n    ATA = np.dot(A.T, A)\n    \n    # Step 2: Use the Jacobian method to find eigenvalues of A^T A\n    def jacobian_eigenvalue_2x2(M, tol=1e-10, max_iter=1000):\n        # Initial guess for the eigenvector\n        v = np.array([1.0, 0.0])\n        v = v / np.linalg.norm(v)\n        \n        for _ in range(max_iter):\n            v_new = np.dot(M, v)\n            v_new = v_new / np.linalg.norm(v_new)\n            \n            if np.linalg.norm(v_new - v) < tol:\n                break\n            \n            v = v_new\n        \n        # Compute the eigenvalue\n        eigenvalue = np.dot(v.T, np.dot(M, v))\n        return eigenvalue, v\n    \n    # Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A^T A\n    eigenvalue1, v1 = jacobian_eigenvalue_2x2(ATA)\n    eigenvalue2, v2 = jacobian_eigenvalue_2x2(ATA - eigenvalue1 * np.outer(v1, v1))\n    \n    # Step 3: Compute the singular values\n    sigma1 = np.sqrt(eigenvalue1)\n    sigma2 = np.sqrt(eigenvalue2)\n    \n    # Step 4: Form the matrix of singular values\n    Sigma = np.array([[sigma1, 0], [0, sigma2]])\n    \n    # Step 5: Form the matrix of right singular vectors\n    V = np.column_stack((v1, v2))\n    \n    # Step 6: Compute the left singular vectors\n    U = np.dot(A, np.dot(V, np.linalg.inv(Sigma)))\n    \n    # Round the results to the nearest 4th decimal\n    U = np.round(U, 4)\n    Sigma = np.round(Sigma, 4)\n    V = np.round(V, 4)\n    \n    return U, Sigma, V\n\n# Example usage:\nA = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\nU, Sigma, V = svd_2x2_singular_values(A)\nprint(\"U:\\n\", U)\nprint(\"Sigma:\\n\", Sigma)\nprint(\"V:\\n\", V)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `svd_2x2_singular_values` that performs SVD on a 2x2 matrix using the Jacobian method.

The results are rounded to the nearest 4th decimal and returned as a Python list.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_correlation_matrix(X, Y=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the correlation matrix for a given dataset.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    X (numpy.ndarray): A 2D numpy array representing the first dataset.\n    Y (numpy.ndarray, optional): A 2D numpy array representing the second dataset.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: The correlation matrix as a Python list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # If Y is not provided, use X for both datasets\n    if Y is None:\n        Y = X\n    \n    # Calculate the correlation matrix using numpy's corrcoef function\n    correlation_matrix = np.corrcoef(X, Y, rowvar=False)\n    \n    # Round the results to the nearest 4th decimal\n    correlation_matrix_rounded = np.round(correlation_matrix, 4)\n    \n    # Convert the numpy array to a list\n    correlation_matrix_list = correlation_matrix_rounded.tolist()\n    \n    return correlation_matrix_list\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Example dataset X\n    X = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\n    \n    # Example dataset Y\n    Y = np.array([[9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4], [3, 2, 1]])\n    \n    # Calculate correlation matrix for X with itself\n    corr_matrix_X = calculate_correlation_matrix(X)\n    print(\"Correlation Matrix of X with itself:\")\n    print(corr_matrix_X)\n    \n    # Calculate correlation matrix for X and Y\n    corr_matrix_XY = calculate_correlation_matrix(X, Y)\n    print(\"\\nCorrelation Matrix of X and Y:\")\n    print(corr_matrix_XY)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `calculate_correlation_matrix` takes two parameters, `X` and `Y`. If `Y` is not provided, it defaults to `None`.\n2. **Handling Y**: If `Y` is `None`, the function sets `Y` to `X`, effectively calculating the correlation matrix of `X` with itself.\n3. **Correlation Calculation**: The function uses `np.corrcoef` to compute the correlation matrix. The `rowvar=False` parameter indicates that rows represent variables and columns represent observations.\n4. **Rounding**: The correlation matrix is rounded to the nearest 4th decimal using `np.round`.\n5. **Conversion to List**: The rounded correlation matrix is converted to a Python list using `tolist()` for the final output.\n6. **Example Usage**: The script includes an example usage section to demonstrate how the function works with sample datasets `X` and `Y`."}

Return these columns as the basis for the column space, rounded to 8 decimal places.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sympy import Matrix\n\ndef matrix_image(A):\n    # Convert the input matrix to a sympy Matrix for easier row reduction\n    A_sympy = Matrix(A)\n    \n    # Get the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of the matrix\n    A_rref, pivot_columns = A_sympy.rref()\n    \n    # Extract the pivot columns from the original matrix A\n    basis_vectors = [A[:, col] for col in pivot_columns]\n    \n    # Convert the list of numpy arrays to a single numpy array\n    basis_matrix = np.column_stack(basis_vectors)\n    \n    # Round the result to 8 decimal places and convert to list\n    basis_matrix_rounded = np.round(basis_matrix, 8).tolist()\n    \n    return basis_matrix_rounded\n\n# Example usage:\nA = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\nprint(matrix_image(A))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We use the `sympy` library to compute the RREF of the matrix, as it provides a convenient method to get both the RREF and the pivot columns.\n- The `rref()` method returns a tuple where the first element is the RREF of the matrix and the second element is a tuple of pivot column indices.\n- We then extract the columns from the original matrix \\( A \\) that correspond to these pivot columns.\n- Finally, we round the resulting matrix to 8 decimal places and convert it to a list for the output.\n\nThis script will correctly compute the basis for the column space of any given matrix \\( A \\)."}

It is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between each true value and the mean of the true values.\n3. **Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)**: This measures the variance in the true values that is not explained by the model. It is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between each true value and the corresponding predicted value.\n4. **R-squared Calculation**: R-squared is calculated as `1 - (RSS / TSS)`, which gives the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).\n5. **Rounding**: The result is rounded to three decimal places for the final output.\n\nYou can test the function with different arrays of `y_true` and `y_pred` to verify its correctness."}

{"task_id": 108, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "To solve the problem of measuring disorder in a basket of apples based on their colors, we can use the concept of entropy from information theory. Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty or disorder in a system. In this context, a basket with all apples of the same color will have zero entropy (no disorder), while a basket with a variety of colors will have higher entropy (more disorder).\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Color**: We need to know how many apples of each color are present in the basket.\n2. **Calculate the Probability of Each Color**: This is the frequency of each color divided by the total number of apples.\n3. **Compute the Entropy**: Use the formula for entropy, which is the sum of `-p_i * log2(p_i)` for each color, where `p_i` is the probability of color `i`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef disorder(apples: list) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a measure of disorder in a basket of apples based on their colors.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not apples:\n        return 0.0\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each color\n    color_counts = Counter(apples)\n    total_apples = len(apples)\n    \n    # Calculate the probability of each color\n    probabilities = [count / total_apples for count in color_counts.values()]\n    \n    # Calculate the entropy (disorder)\n    entropy = -sum(p * math.log2(p) for p in probabilities if p > 0)\n    \n    # Return the entropy rounded to the nearest 4th decimal\n    return round(entropy, 4)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(disorder([0, 0, 0, 0]))          # Should yield 0.0000\nprint(disorder([1, 1, 0, 0]))          # Should yield a value greater than 0.0000\nprint(disorder([0, 1, 2, 3]))          # Should yield a value greater than the previous\nprint(disorder([0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]))  # Should yield a value greater than [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Counter**: We use `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each color.\n- **Probabilities**: We calculate the probability of each color by dividing its count by the total number of apples.\n- **Entropy Calculation**: We compute the entropy using the formula `-sum(p * log2(p))`, which is a standard way to measure disorder in a system.\n- **Rounding**: The result is rounded to the nearest 4th decimal place as required.\n\nThis implementation satisfies the conditions given in the task description, where the disorder increases with the variety of colors in the basket."}
