At this point, it returns the current position, which is the position of the minimum.\n\nThe function `f` and its derivative `df` are defined inside `find_treasure`, so they are not accessible outside of it. This is a common practice in Python to prevent accidental modification of these functions.\n\nThe result is rounded to the nearest 4th decimal using the `round` function.\n"}
{"task_id": 128, "completion_id": 0, "completion": "Here is a Python script that implements the Dynamic Tanh function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef dynamic_tanh(x: np.ndarray, alpha: float, gamma: float, beta: float) -> list[float]:\n    # Calculate the mean of the input array\n    mean = np.mean(x)\n    \n    # Calculate the standard deviation of the input array\n    std_dev = np.std(x)\n    \n    # Calculate the dynamic tanh\n    dy_tanh = alpha * np.tanh(beta * ((x - mean) / std_dev)) * gamma\n    \n    # Round the results to the nearest 4th decimal\n    dy_tanh = np.round(dy_tanh, 4)\n    \n    # Convert the numpy array to a python list\n    dy_tanh_list = dy_tanh.tolist()\n    \n    return dy_tanh_list\n```\n\nThis script first calculates the mean and standard deviation of the input array. It then calculates the dynamic tanh by applying the formula `alpha * tanh(beta * ((x - mean) / std_dev)) * gamma`. The results are then rounded to the nearest 4th decimal and converted to a python list.\n\nPlease note that this script assumes that the input array `x` is a numpy array. If it's not, you may need to convert it to a numpy array first.\n"}
