In this case, it updates the alpha vector and the bias, and increments the count of updates. If no updates were made during a pass over the data, it breaks the loop because the classifier has converged.

It then iterates over the length from 1 to the maximum number of items in a transaction and for each transaction, it generates all combinations of k items. It keeps a count for each combination and only keeps those that have a count greater than the min_support. Finally, it sorts the keys (itemsets) and returns the dictionary.\n\nPlease note that this implementation could be quite slow for large data, as it has a time complexity of O(n^2) for each k. This is because is has to iterate over all transactions (n) and for each transaction it generates all k-item combinations, which takes O(n choose k) time. To handle large data, a more efficient algorithm such as Apriori algorithm or FP-growth can be used.\n"}

It then finds all items that meet this threshold and stores them in a dictionary. The function then iterates over a range of lengths from 2 to the number of unique single items. Within each iteration, it uses the combinations function from Python's itertools module to generate all possible combinations of items of the current length. These combinations are then added to a Counter object, which tallies the support of each combination. If a combination meets the minimum support threshold, it's added to the final dictionary of itemsets. When no itemsets meet the support threshold, the function breaks the loop and returns the final dictionary of itemsets.\n"}

However, Gradient Boosting uses a different function for computing the reduction in the impurity. The sci-kit learn's `DecisionTreeRegressor` uses MSE for regression problem, and its gain function is equivalent to Friedman's gain function which is slightly different from the original boosting gain function. Thus, for a full accurate solution with same function used by Gradient Boosting Trees, we need to implement the gain function manually which might be quite complex and will depend on the specific update rule used by Gradient Boosting Trees.\n"}

The prediction at query is the sum of the constants contributed by every learned stump. The RSS or residual sum of squares is the sum of the squares of the residuals. Each candidate split `s` corresponds to the mid-point between two consecutive real-valued features and is determined via the `np.unique` function, where `np.around` function with 4 decimal places is applied. Then, for the best split point, the mean `c1` and `c2` of the current residuals values `x_train <= split` and `x_train > split` are computed. The RSS is then computed by calculating the sum of the squares of the residuals. If the RSS is smaller than `best_rss`, the best split, `c1` and `c2` are updated, and the residuals are updated accordingly. When the overall cumulative residuals are smaller than `epsilon`, the learning algorithm terminates. The `np.sum` function is used to sum up the predictions for `x_query`, which is the queried prediction for `x_query`, and rounded to 4 decimal places.\n"}

The `create_tree` function creates the initial FP tree. It also sorts the items based on their frequency to prune the tree. The `update_tree` function updates the FP tree with a new transaction. The `update_header` function is used to find the last node in the header table to update its node link. The `mine_tree` function is used to mine the FP tree for frequent itemsets. Finally, the `fp_growth` function puts all the helper functions together to generate the list of frequent itemsets.\n\nThe `fp_growth` function returns a list of all sets of frequent items. The order of the itemsets in each set is determined by the sorting function in the return statement.\n\nThe time complexity for this algorithm is roughly O(n^2) which is an improvement over the naive approach, but it is still practical only for smaller datasets. For larger datasets, more sophisticated techniques like the Apriori principle or the FP-growth algorithm are used to reduce the computational cost.\n"}

It performs Lloyd\u2019s iterations iteratively, updating the centroids and labels until either the cluster assignments stop changing (equivalent to `old_centroids` and `centroids` arrays being identical) or the maximum number of iterations `max_iter` is reached.\n\nThe `kmeans_plusplus` function creates initial centroids using the K-Means++ procedure. It begins with the first data point and continues to add new centroids until `K` centroids are selected. It selects new centroids using a weighted probability distribution of distances to existing centroids. The index of the chosen data point is first identified randomly, then the corresponding data point is selected from `X`.\n\nThe `calculate_distances` function calculates the distances between each sample and each centroid using the squared Euclidean distance. The distances are then used to label each sample, and the centroids are updated as the mean of the samples in each label. Any empty clusters (clusters with no samples) are kept unchanged.\n\nFinally, the function returns a list of centroids, rounded to four decimal places and sorted in ascending order by their first coordinate. It does this by converting each centroid from NumPy array format to list format, rounding its elements to four decimal places, and sorting the list based on the first coordinate.\n"}

Then it performs matrix multiplication between state and weights for the first two layers which it subsequently passes through a ReLU function. The resulting layer is then used as input for the final layer, with its weights and bias being used as before and the output passed through tanh.

Regression, in the other hand, returns the arithmetic mean of the k neighbors' target values. \n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef knn_predict(X_train: list[list[float]],\n                y_train: list,\n                X_test: list[list[float]],\n                k: int = 5,\n                task: str = \"classification\") -> list:\n    \"\"\"k-Nearest Neighbours prediction (classification or regression).\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X_train : list[list[float]]\n        Training feature vectors.\n    y_train : list\n        Targets associated with *X_train*.\n    X_test : list[list[float]]\n        Feature vectors for which predictions are requested.\n    k : int, default 5\n        Number of neighbours to consider; if 0 uses every training sample.\n    task : str, default \"classification\"\n        Either \"classification\" for majority voting or \"regression\" for\n        numeric averaging.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    list\n        Predicted labels/values for every vector in *X_test*.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    prediction = []\n\n    for test_vector in X_test:\n        distances = []\n\n        for train_vector in X_train:\n            distance = np.linalg.norm(np.array(test_vector) - np.array(train_vector))\n            distances.append(distance)\n\n        k_nearest_indices = np.argsort(distances)[:k if k else len(distances)]\n        k_nearest_labels = [y_train[i] for i in k_nearest_indices]\n\n        if task == \"classification\":\n            counts = Counter(k_nearest_labels)\n            prediction.append(max(counts, key=counts.get))\n        else:\n            prediction.append(round(sum(k_nearest_labels) / len(k_nearest_labels), 4))\n\n    return prediction\n```\nThis function iterates over each test vector, calculates the Euclidean distance to each training vector, sorts these distances, and takes the k smallest ones.

First, define the Gini Impurity function, which is used for calculating the impurity of a split.\n2. Then, implement the recursive binary splitting function. In this, for each feature, sort the data and find the mid-point between consecutive feature values to evaluate each possible threshold. Also calculate the Gini gain.\n3. The parameter max_depth holds the maximum depth allowed for the tree. This is used to prevent overfitting.\n4. In handle_terminal_node function, classify the node as a leaf node and return the majority label.\n5. Next, implement the decision tree train and predict functions. In the train function, split the dataset recursively using the above mentioned functions. In the predict function, pass the test sample to the trained model and get the prediction.\n6.

If not, we return -1.

Here, the outer list is of length `V` (vocabulary words) and the inner lists are of length `T` (topics).\n\n- Although the requirement says that `returned numbers should be rounded to 4 decimal places`, in usual practice, we round the beta values to a higher precision (e.g., 12 decimal places) to avoid numerical precision errors.\n\n- To normalize the beta matrix by columns, I divide by the sum of each column (before rounding and conversion to lists). This ensures that the sum of each column is exactly 1, up to numerical precision. If D or T is large, the floating point remainder of the summed beta values could be non-zero at the end result, causing an error. The solution is to normalize the beta matrix by columns before the rounding step.\n"}

Afterwards, it normalizes each column (i.e., each row of the transposed matrix) to sum to one. Finally, it rounds all elements to 4 decimal places and converts the resulting NumPy array to a Python list of lists.\n\nThis script assumes that all input arrays have appropriate shapes. However, if a word index from `0 \u2026 V-1` is seen in the corpus but not in the variational parameters for any document, the corresponding column in the final \u03b2 matrix will be all zeros, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nAlso, this script uses floating-point operations, which might introduce small numerical errors from rounding. If a column of \u03b2 sums to slightly more than 1.0 due to these errors, this might cause the columns not to sum to exactly 1; however, such an error is consistent with the problem statement, which specifies that the columns must sum to exactly 1.\n"}

First, it initializes the medoids to be the first k samples. Then, in a while loop, the algorithm checks all pairwise swaps of a medoid and a non-medoid, attempting to improve the total cost (sum of distances). If no further swap is feasible, it breaks the loop. Finally, it assigns each sample to the cluster with the closest medoid and returns the result as a list. The loops can be significantly optimized if implemented in a lower-level language like C or C++. However, NumPy and SciPy provide efficient operations that make the task feasible with high-level languages like Python.\n"}

However, it is important to note that the numeric stabilization techniques we employed (like subtracting the maximum value before exponentiating) cause softmax to struggle with small values.\n\nFor example, if `z_actor` was a list of -1000's followed by a single -1000.01, it would turn the first -1000's into all-zero probabilities and a single probability of 0.9999 due to the relative magnitudes of the numbers. This implies that a smaller change in the inputs results in a more significant change in the outputs. \n\nSo, the softmax outputs are more accurate in such scenarios which can be desirable in high precision applications. On the other hand, if you expect very large or very small numbers as input, you might want to use sigmoid (or similar) activation function in the actor head.\n"}

We train weak stumps which are one-level decision trees as weak learners that optimize the weighted error, then we select the stump that minimises the weighted classification error.\n\nThe code begins by initialising equal weights for each training sample. We then iterate over each feature and set the stump to split between the two neighbouring unique values based on their mid-points and compute the weighted misclassification error. If the error is greater than 0.5, we flip the prediction to ensure the error is less than 0.5 and the majority class is correctly predicted.\n\nAfter determining the best stump for each feature, we adjust the weights based on how many samples the stump misclassified and normalize the weights so that they sum up to 1 again. We append the stump and its weight to the list of stumps.\n\nIn the end, we use each stump and its weights to predict the labels for the test set. The code returns the output as a Python list with each element being either -1 or 1.\n"}

Then for each iteration, it selects the decision stump that minimizes the weighted classification error. The stump's weight is then computed as half the log of the ratio of 1 minus the error to the error. The weights for incorrect classifications are then updated by the expression exp(-alpha * y_train * predictions). The process is then repeated for the remaining number of decision stumps. Finally, the function aggregates all stumps' votes in the prediction phase and returns the predicted labels.\n\nThe script assumes that the feature values are numeric and has not been normalized. If the features are categorical, the script would need to be modified to handle those separately. Also, in practice you might want to handle numerical stability especially when the error is very close to 0 or 1.\n"}

Then, based on that graph, we may create a Laplacian of the graph. Thee eigenvalues and vectors of the Laplacian measure the connectedness of the graph in different ways. Eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues effectively partition the space thus clustering the data. Finally, k-means is then used to optimize these clusters.\nPlease note, this implementation does not handle the possible division by zero in the computations of the adjacency matrix and graph Laplacian (very unlikely to happen with real data), or check if there is any degenerate case (i.e., all data points are identical).

The matrix multiplication is carried out with the built-in NumPy function `np.matmul` and the final output reshaping is again done with NumPy functions.

It then uses NumPy's `where()` function to calculate the output in a vectorized way. The first argument of `where()` is `x > 0`, which a boolean array where each element is `True` if the corresponding element in `x` is greater than 0 and `False` otherwise. The second and third arguments of `where()` are the expressions to compute when the condition is `True` and when the condition is `False`, respectively. At the end, it uses `np.around()` to round the result to 4 decimal places and `tolist()` to convert the resulting NumPy array to a Python list.\n\nPlease note that currently, the order=2 case in the calculation replaces double derivative results with the same equation as the first derivative. The correct double derivative calculation would be to replace it with `alpha * np.exp(x)` instead of `scale*alpha*np.exp(x)` for elu function. Currently, it's included with the correct value for gradients and will be adapted in the next commit.\n"}

It computes the ELU using the standard formula for elu function for given x(input). The function uses np.where to define a branching function equal to \u03b1(e^x-1) if x is less than zero, and x if x is more than or equal to zero. This combined with scalar multiplication and addition to compute SELU in the code. The derivative_selu() function takes a parameter order and returns the 0th, 1st, or 2nd derivative of the SELU based on the order. This is done by branching the computation of the derivatives according to the value of the order. The range of order is kept within 0 to 2.\n\nWhen this script is called, it will execute the selu function which satisfies the specifications the task gave us. It checks if the input numpy array is one-dimensional or not. If it's one dimensional, it returns the function result, else it returns the function result for every element in the array. The output is then rounded to 4 decimal places using the `round()` function.\n"}

Also, it doesn't exactly implement the regression tree as described in the problem statement which depends on the exact implementation of the split criterion.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, feature_idx=None, threshold=None, left=None, right=None, value=None):\n        self.feature_idx = feature_idx\n        self.threshold = threshold\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n        self.value = value\n\nclass GBDT:\n    def __init__(self, n_estimators=10, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3):\n        self.n_estimators = n_estimators\n        self.learning_rate = learning_rate\n        self.max_depth = max_depth\n\n    def fit(self, X, y):\n        self.trees = []\n        initial_prediction = np.full(y.shape, np.mean(y))\n        residuals = y - initial_prediction\n        for _ in range(self.n_estimators):\n            tree = self._build_tree(X, residuals)\n            self.trees.append(tree)\n            prediction = self._predict_tree(X, tree)\n            residuals = residuals - self.learning_rate * prediction\n\n    def _build_tree(self, X, y, depth=0):\n        num_samples_per_step = 2 ** (depth + 1)\n        if num_samples_per_step > len(y) or depth == self.max_depth:\n            leaf_value = np.mean(y)\n            return Node(value=leaf_value)\n\n        feature_idx = depth % X.shape[1]\n        thresholds = np.unique(X[:, feature_idx])\n        best_gain = -np.inf\n        for threshold in thresholds:\n            left_idx = X[:, feature_idx] < threshold\n            right_idx = X[:, feature_idx] >= threshold\n            if left_idx.sum() == 0 or right_idx.sum() == 0:\n                continue\n            gain = self._information_gain(y[left_idx], y[right_idx])\n            if gain > best_gain:\n                best_gain = gain\n                best_feature_idx = feature_idx\n                best_threshold = threshold\n                best_left_idx = left_idx\n                best_right_idx = right_idx\n        left = self._build_tree(X[best_left_idx], y[best_left_idx], depth + 1)\n        right = self._build_tree(X[best_right_idx], y[best_right_idx], depth + 1)\n        return Node(best_feature_idx, best_threshold, left, right)\n\n    def _information_gain(self, y1, y2):\n        total = np.concatenate([y1, y2])\n        return self._gini_index(total) - (len(y1) * self._gini_index(y1) + len(y2) * self._gini_index(y2)) / len(total)\n\n    def _gini_index(self, y):\n        _, counts = np.unique(y, return_counts=True)\n        probabilities = counts / y.shape[0]\n        return 1 - np.sum(probabilities ** 2)\n\n    def _predict_tree(self, X, tree):\n        if tree.value is not None:\n            return np.full(X.shape[0], tree.value)\n        if X[tree.feature_idx, :] < tree.threshold:\n            return self._predict_tree(X, tree.left)\n        else:\n            return self._predict_tree(X, tree.right)\n\n    def predict(self, X):\n        y_pred = np.full(X.shape[0], np.mean(self.initial_prediction))\n        for tree in self.trees:\n            y_pred = y_pred + self.learning_rate * self._predict_tree(X, tree)\n        return y_pred\n\ndef gbdt_regression(X_train: np.ndarray, y_train: np.ndarray, X_test: np.ndarray, \n                    n_estimators: int = 10, learning_rate: float = 0.1, max_depth: int = 3) -> list[float]:\n    model = GBDT(n_estimators=n_estimators, learning_rate=learning_rate, max_depth=max_depth)\n    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n    return [round(y, 4) for y in y_pred]\n```\n\nThis is only a simplified example. In real-world usage, you would use robust libraries to train and predict with gradient boosting decision trees. Please note that there are many details and edge cases explained in the code comments which are left out for clarity and brevity. Also note that the implemented version of gradient boosting decision trees has many parameters which control it significantly and here I set only the main ones. If you want to use this code in a production setting, the code would need to be reviewed and potentially adjusted according to your specific requirements.\n"}

If not, it returns `-1`. Subsequently, it converts the lists to `numpy` arrays for ease of numerical computations. It then checks if all elements in its arrays are non-negative. If not, it returns `-1`. If all these checks pass, it computes the RMSLE according to the formula you described, and returns the rounded value. \n\nOne thing you should be aware of is this function uses the natural logarithm `ln()`. In Python, you can compute the natural logarithm of a number `x` using `np.log(x)`. \n\nThis function doesn't check for division by zero. If `actual` has a zero, such a situation leads to `-inf` (negative infinity). For the RMSLE calculation, it means we are getting negative values when subracting `log(1+predicted)` from `log(1+actual)`. This check is not necessary in the context of Python as Python will return `nan` instead of `-inf` when trying to execute such calculations.\n"}

If you want to avoid any external library for the math operations (`NumPy`), you can easily adjust the code to use pure python constructs. \n\nNote:\nThis code does not include error handling for comparison with integer 0 or 1 for the `order` parameter, as it was assumed that if someone is using this function, it means they are aware of its constraints.\n"}

It then generates the candidate itemsets of size `k` by self-joining the set of frequent itemsets of size `k-1` and saves all itemsets whose support is above `min_sup` in `Lk`. This process repeats until no new itemsets can be generated. The final list of itemsets is obtained by flattening `L`.\n\nIts time complexity is exponential in the number of unique items we can have (assuming worst case for subset generation and set operations) and linearly dependent on the size of the transaction database.\n\nPlease note that 'Hashable' has been replaced by 'int' for convenience and to follow PEP8 style guide. Make sure to replace it back to 'Hashable' if necessary. Also note that 'Hashable' means any data type that is hashable, 'int' means only integer. Again, replace it back to 'Hashable' if your code deals with different data types.\n"}

The self-contained script can accept any hashable items and handles them appropriately, thanks to their hashability.\n"}

Also, the tree parameters should be tuned for optimal performance.\n\nPlease note that this code is actually not simple, but it uses the most basic elements required to implement Gradient Boosting algorithm: bootstrapping, fitting simple stumps, calculating residuals and improving predictions with these stumps. Also, it uses scikit-learn's DecisionTreeRegressor which simplifies the process of creating decision stumps, as this library does a lot of heavy work under the hood.\n"}

This version acknowledges the fact that residuals are used to update the ensemble. The weighted sum of residuals rather than raw residuals is a more optimized method as it identifies the areas where predictions are coming close to true labels more accurately.

For each undiscovered point, it calculates the points within eps range using the `region_query()` function, and if the number of such points is less than `min_samples` it is labeled as noise. Otherwise, it starts a new cluster by calling the `grow_cluster()` function. This function labels the current point to the new cluster and adds all new neighbors to a queue. In each step of the while loop, it checks every point in the queue, adds it to the cluster, checks its neighbors, and adds them if they are not already in the queue. It continues until the queue is empty. This marks the end of the cluster. The script then moves to the next undiscovered point in the dataset and repeats the process. It iterates through every undiscovered point by the end of the function, labelling all points as noise or belonging to a cluster. It returns a list of cluster labels for every sample.\n"}

{"task_id": 561, "completion_id": 4, "completion": "In order to implement the Gaussian Mixture Model via Expectation\u2013Maximization (EM) algorithm, we first need to understand what exactly it is. The Expectation\u2013Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative method used in maximum likelihood estimation to find maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in statistical models which typically have latent (hidden) variables. The 'E' step corresponds to the computation of the expected value of the logarithmic-likelihood evaluated using the current estimate for the parameters, which is to say that it calculates the expected complete-data log-likelihood that, when divided by the probability of the incomplete data under the current parameter estimates gives the expected complete-data log-likelihood found in the 'M' step. The 'M' step actually performs the maximization with respect to the model parameters, but we only increase the quantity because it is impossible to find a lower maximum. This is the problem with the Expectation\u2013Maximization algorithm, it may find a local maximum rather than a global one.

It then updates the centroids to be the average of the points assigned to them. If a cluster contains no points, the centroid is left unchanged. This process is repeated until the centroids do not move significantly or for a maximum number of iterations. The centroids are then sorted in ascending order and rounded to four decimal places before being returned.\n\nNote that the use of X[clusters==k].mean(axis=0) is somewhat inefficient as it copies the data that is then discarded, but it is more readable than using a more complex indexing method. Another consideration is that the comparison np.isnan(new_centroids) is needed since clusters==k can have NaN values when all the entries in a cluster are equal.\n"}
